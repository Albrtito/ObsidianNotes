# Abstract Data Types
## Abstract data types: (ADT)

>[!note] Intro: 
> An ADT is a theoretical data type. It takes some variables(values) and has certain aviable operations between them.

## Linear ADT

> [!note] 
> A linear ADT represents a sequence of **consecutive elements**. 
+ **Saving sequentially is key for optimization**
+ We can think about **vectors as linear ADTs**
+ Usually, all elements in the linear ADT are of the same type.

## Relation between ADT and data structures:

>[!note]
 > A data structure is an implementation of an ADT in a programming language.

- In python the ADT is represented as a class
- A class can defined how the values are given and defines a certain number of methods that are the operations of the ADT.
