# Protocol - FDMA

> [!NOTE] Def: 
>  The FDMA protocol is a channel partitioning protocol for the link layer of the network stack. It divides the link medium into multiple frequency slots. Each host takes one of those slots and sends data over it. 

## Pros and Cons:
+ Same as all channel partition protocols.
