# Protocol - FDMA

> [!NOTE] Def: 
>  The FDMA protocol is a channel partitioning protocol for the link layer of the network stack. It divides the link medium into multiple frequency slots. 

+ Each station is assigned a **fixed frequency band**
**Advantages:** 
+ For high loades of traffic it is really useful. 

**Disadvantages:** 
+ If the load of the system is not as hight, there will be packets that cannot be transfered but are not really waiting for anyone. Wasting resources.
