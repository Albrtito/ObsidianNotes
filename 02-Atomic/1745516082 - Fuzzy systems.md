# Fuzzy systems
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> How can we use the [[1745512462 - Fuzzy logic|Fuzzy logic]] into real world examples, where there is a need for crisp values? 
> We can create a **fuzzifier and defuzzifier** to transform a value into a fuzzy value and then transform it back again to a crisp value. 
> 
> This fuzzy systems now still have to find a way to get a final solution from a bunch of fuzzy rules, we can do this by applying [[1745516400 - Fuzzy inference|Fuzzy inference]]
