# Fuzzy logic
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Fuzzy logic transforms exact numerical terms into more **fuzzy/natural descriptions**. 

>f.e: Break at 50% level => Break slowly

This type of definition involves some questions that need answering:
1. How can we define this natural descriptions?
2. How can we combine this natural descriptions using known connectives such as AND or OR
3. How can we combine different rules into one final output?
## Fuzzy sets:
In order to define this natural descriptions we need to group large numbers of values that variables can take into sets (fuzzy sets) and create some function that given a value returns the set it belongs to. 

> f.e: Lets define some set A:S → {0,1}
> And now define the value mu based on x that return one of two possibilities wether x belongs to set A or not
>$$
\mu_A(x)= \begin{cases}1 & \text { if } x \text { is an element of set } A \\ 0 & \text { if } x \text { is not an element of set } A\end{cases}
$$

This method however discriminates to all those values that are **close to be inside a set but are not**.
> If we say that tall is someone with height=1.8m then by this definition anotherone with height = 1.79 meters wont be categorized as tall. 

In order to solve this we’ll adapt the definition of our function mu in order to re
