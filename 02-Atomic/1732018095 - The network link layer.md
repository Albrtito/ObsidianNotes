# The network link layer

> [!attention] Biblio reference: 
> The wifi is really compact in the UC3M course and given with LANs. We wont be seeing the whole WIFI chapter. 
> 

> [!NOTE] Definition (MAIN IDEA):  
> The link layer has the **responsability of transferring a datagram from one node to a physically adjacent node over a link**. 
> + Connect a ONE LINK HOP
>   
> Each link is different and therefore needs a different protocol. 

> [!example] Notation: 
> **host and routers = nodes:** From the link layer point of view all devices at the edges of the link are nodes and there are no differences between them. 
> **links:** The communication channels that connet adjacent nodes. There are severl types. 
> **packet → FRAME:** The packet of the link layer is a frame, it **encapsulates the network layer packet (datagram)**
>**MAC Addresses** 

## Link layer services: 
+ **Framing:** 
  + The encapsulation of the datagram into a frame. A **header and trailer are added** 
  + Mediación / organisation of the used medium in shared channels 
  + **MAC addresses**,
