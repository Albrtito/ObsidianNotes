# CIDR Notation
When working with IP addresses we use CIDR notation to **reference groups of IP Adresses.**

If we want to reference large groups of IPs we could just say: 
> â€œfrom the 192.34.23.0 to the 192.34.24.0

Which would theoretically include all the ones with any value in the fourth position and either 23 or 24 as the third number. 

However, because we study computer science and life could not make things easier for us we opt for using another notation (sure it makes some things easier), this notation is based on **the number of bits that define the group of IP addresses we are refering to.** 

> In the previous example we could say that the first 23 bits are the ones that define the group as they never change. Then we write:
>
