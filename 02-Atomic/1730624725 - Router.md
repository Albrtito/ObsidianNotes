# Router
## Hight-level Architecture:
![[Screenshot 2024-11-03 at 10.09.35 AM.png|center|600]]

+ **Input ports:** 
  Where physical-layer links terminate. 
  + The actual input ports **requests the forwarding tables information** to know where to send the packets. The request and computation is then performed in the **routing processor.** 
    
+ **Switching fabric:** Connection of the input ports to the output ports.

+ **Output ports:** Get packets from the switching fabric and transmit them to the outgoing link.

+ **Routing processor (a CPU):** 
	+ Performs the [[1730567097 - The network layer control plane|Control plane]] functions. 
	+ Saves and computes the forwarding tables.
	+ Executes routing protocols 
	+ Recieves and communicates with remote controllers (in SDN approach). 
	+ Performs network management funcitons.


> [!ATTENTION] Remark 
> See that input-output ports and switching fabrics implementations **must be done directly into the hardware in order to keep up whith the necessary speed**. 
> However the routing processor is implemented in software as the speed of its functions is not that important.
