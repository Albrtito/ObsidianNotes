# Router
## Hight-level Architecture:
![[Screenshot 2024-11-03 at 10.09.35 AM.png|center|600]]

+ **Input ports:** 
  Where physical-layer links terminate. 
  + The actual input ports **requests the forwarding tables information** to know where to send the packets. The request and computation is then performed in the **routing processor.**  This whole function is called [[1730648938 - Input port processing in routers|Input port processing]]
    
+ **Switching fabric:** Connection of the input ports to the output ports.
	+ 

+ **Output ports:** Get packets from the switching fabric and transmit them to the outgoing link.
	+ There is a queue based on the time to retransmit 
	+ Output ports can **select and schedule packets**: FIFO, Round Robin, etc.

+ **Routing processor (a CPU):** 
	+ Performs the [[1730567097 - The network layer control plane|Control plane]] functions. 
	+ Saves and computes the forwarding tables.
	+ Executes routing protocols 
	+ Recieves and communicates with remote controllers (in SDN approach). 
	+ Performs network management funcitons.


> [!ATTENTION] Remark 
> See that input-output ports and switching fabrics implementations **must be done directly into the hardware in order to keep up whith the necessary speed**. 
> However the routing processor is implemented in software as the speed of its functions is not that important.

## Switching fabrics:
In order for the input ports to send data into the output ports a conection between both of them is needed. 
This connection is called a switching fabric as it **switches (forwards) packets from input to output**. There are several ways of creating switching fabrics based on the hardware used. 
+ **Memory switching:** As in any common computer, the CPU (routerâ€™s processor) copies the packages into the memory and then back to the output buffer.
	+ Treats input/output ports as I-O  devices
+ **Bus switching:** Packets are sent over a bus. 
	+ Only one packet at a time, others wait
	+ Control headers added to distinguuish which port keeps each packet.
+ **Interconnection network:** A network inside the router. NxM (N: input ports, M: Output). 
	+ Still have the problem of two inputs into the same output
