# SQL

> [!NOTE]  Intro: 
> Sql or **Structured Query Language** is used to implement [[1739551767 - Relational DB Model|Relational DB Model]] using three types of instructions, gathered under three subsets.
> 1. [[1743006292 - SQL DDL|Data Definition Language]]
> 2. Data Manipulation Language

## Defining SQL:
When looking at the SQL definitions there is several terms and ways of defining elements and the syntax of the language: 

> [!example] Dictionary: 
> + **`:=`** : Symbol used for “is defined by” or “can be substituted by”
> > f.e: element := element_value
> > Defines that element can be substituted by element_value.  
> + **Defining the language**:
> 	+ Whatever is inside brackets **[]** is some **optional values that the query takes**
> 	+ Whatever is inside keys **{}** is a **logical expresion like OR (|) or AND()**
> 	+ Those values inside **<>** are specific names for whatever object or name is described inside. 
> 		+ When in plural they are **separated by a comma**


## Basic things:
+ SQL is **NOT CASE SENSITIVE** , snake_case is usually used 
+ **Comments in SQL** are done with `--`
