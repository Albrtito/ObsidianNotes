# Network Address Translation (NAT)

> [!NOTE] Intro:
> The network address translation or NAT **creates a bridge between the WAN and LAN** sides of a network.
> 
+ This is because private LAN  networks have addresses in the range of: 
  $$ 10.0.0.0/8$$
  $$172.16.0.0/12$$
  $$192.168.0.0/16$$
+ A translation table is created from public to local addresses.
