# Protocol - TDMA
The TDMA protocol is a channel partitioning protocol for the link layer of the network stack. It divides the link medium into multiple time slots. 
+ A lenght slot is defined where the lenght is some time. 

**Advantages:** 
+ For high loades of traffic it is really useful. 

**Disadvantages:** 
+ If the load of the system is not as hight, there will be packets that cannot be transfered but are not really waiting for anyone. Wasting resources.
