# IPv4 protocol
The IPv4 protocol is the first network addressing protocol created. It’s purpose is to d**efine the format that a datagram** (packet in the network layer) should have and **give an unique identifier to each host in the network**
## Datagram format: 

+ The packet will have a total of 20 bytes of header assuming no options.
+ Options are rarely used (deleted in the IPv6 for a reason)
+ **Because the existance of options wont allow for a direct knowledge of where the data begins the header lenght field is added**

### Fields:
Collection of the most important fields, or those that are not self explanatory.
+ **Version number:** Differntiate between IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams in order to know how to read it.
+ **Header lenght:** This field is used to know whether the datagram contains options or not. This allows to **know where the actual data begins**.
+ **Time to live:** Nº of max hops allowed inside the network before being dropped.
+ **Protocol:** Transport protocol being used

## IPv4 Addressing:
Each IP address is 32 bits long (4 bytes). 

$$
11000001\space 00100000 \space11011000 \space00001001
$$

+ A **total of $2^32$ ( $\equiv$ 4 billion)** possible IP addresses. 
+ Usually written in **dotted-decimal notation**. The example above would be:
  $$ 193.32.216.$$
  

+ **All interfaces must have an UNIQUE address** (See NATs for exceptions)
+ IP Networks where each host has its own IP address are called [[1730827988 - Subnets|Subnets]].
+ Addresses are written in their generalised [[1730832772 - CIDR Notation|CIDR]] notation.
+ A **broadcast address** is stablished as the $255.255.255.255$. If a host uses this address to send information, all host connected to the network (and set to accept it) will get the info.

## Distributing addresses:

> [!BUG] Problem 
> But how do companies and hosts get their addresses? If addresses must be unique there must be some way of making sure that it stays that way.
> 

> [!check] Solution: 
> IP addresses for  organisations are given by the  ISPs. Each ISP is given some big address block that it then divides into smaller blocks for whoever is asking.
> 
> In the same way, ISPs will get their addresses by the ICANN(Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), who also manages DNS.
