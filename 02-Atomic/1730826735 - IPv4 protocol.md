# IPv4 protocol
The IPv4 protocol is the first network addressing protocol created. It’s purpose is to d**efine the format that a datagram** (packet in the network layer) should have and **give an unique identifier to each host in the network**
## Datagram format: 

+ The packet will have a total of 20 bytes of header assuming no options.
+ Options are rarely used (deleted in the IPv6 for a reason)
+ **Because the existance of options wont allow for a direct knowledge of where the data begins the header lenght field is added**

### Fields:
Collection of the most important fields, or those that are not self explanatory.
+ **Version number:** Differntiate between IPv4 and IPv6 datagrams in order to know how to read it.
+ **Header lenght:** This field is used to know whether the datagram contains options or not. This allows to **know where the actual data begins**.
+ **Time to live:** Nº of max hops allowed inside the network before being dropped.
+ **Protocol:** Transport protocol being used

## IPv4 Addressing:
Each IP address is 32 bits long (4 bytes). 

$$
11000001 00100000 11011000 00001001
$$

+ A **total of $2^32$ ( $\equiv$ 4 billion)** possible IP addresses. 
+ Usually written in **dotted-decimal notation**. The example above would be:
  $$ 193.32.216.$$
  

+ **All interfaces must have an UNIQUE address** (See NATs for exceptions)
