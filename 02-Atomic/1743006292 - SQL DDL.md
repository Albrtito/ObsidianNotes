# SQL DDL

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> The SQL **Data Definition Language** is the one in charge of implementing all the theory described in the [[1739552040 - DB Relational Statics|DB Relational Statics]]. 
> It defines objects using instructions for: 
> + **Creation**
> + **Suppresion/Deletion**
> + **Alteration**

## Creation:
THe creation operation is called `CREATE` and can be applied on schemas, tables, views, domains, sequences and any objects that the language has. 

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	table_element 
	[, table_element[,...]]
);
```

**Where:**
The table elements are described such as:
```SQL
table_element := {column_def | table_constraint}
column_def := column_name datatype(max_size)
			[column_val]
			[column_constraint]
column_val := {
			DEFAULT value | 
			GENERATED {ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT} AS IDENTITY [(START WITH int [,INCREMENT BY int])]}
```

The constraints of columns and tables are described in the following way, in both cases the constraint must be given a name.
```SQL
column_constraint := {[NOT] NULL | PRIMARY KEY | UNIQUE | REFERENCES ... | CHECK (...)} [STATE {ENABLE | DISABLE}]
```

```SQL
table_constraint := {PRIMARY KEY (col[,...]) | UNIQUE (col[,...]) | FOREIGN KEY (col[,...]) REFERENCES ... | CHECK (...)} [STATE {ENABLE|DISABLE}]
```

See that the **foreign key table constraint** has more to it than the others as the rules to [[1739552040 - DB Relational Statics#Protecting referential integrity|protect referential integrity]] must be applied.
```SQL

```


**Remarks:**
+ Each table element (besides the first one) starts with a comma. Last one does not have comma at the end
+ See the datatypes in [[#Datatypes]]
