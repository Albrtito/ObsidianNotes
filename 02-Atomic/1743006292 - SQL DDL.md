# SQL DDL

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> The SQL **Data Definition Language** is the one in charge of implementing all the theory described in the [[1739552040 - DB Relational Statics|DB Relational Statics]]. 
> It defines objects using instructions for: 
> + **Creation**
> + **Suppresion/Deletion**
> + **Alteration**

## Creation:
THe creation operation is called `CREATE` and can be applied on schemas, tables, views, domains, sequences and any objects that the language has. 

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	table_element 
	[, table_element[,...]]
);
```
**Remarks:**
+ Each table element (besides the first one) starts with a comma. Last one does not have comma at the end
**Where:**
```SQL
table_element := {column_def | table_constraint}
column_def := column_name datatype(max_size)
			[column_val]
			[column_const]
```
