# Relational DB Model

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> The relational model of a database or is an schema used for defining the relations between the data. This schema contains two different relations: 
> + [[1739552040 - DB Relational Statics|DB Relational Statics]]
> + [[1739196838 - DB Relational dynamics|DB Relational dynamics]]

**Remarks:**
+ Comments to further explain the model are needed. Without them there is not enough coverage. This coverage is further explained in [[#Design documentation]]

## Design documentation:
The whole design must be completed by adding documentation that details several aspects of the model and can be separated into:

+ **Explicit semantica assumption:** any requirement **provided by the client** 
+ **Non-observed explicit semantic assumption:** What is **not included in the proposed design**.
	+ A possible solution may be given 
+ **Implicit semantic assumptions:** Info **not provided by the client** but taken into account as it is needed for the design.
