# Random variables

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> In oposed to [[20240523 - 122919 - Propositional logic|Propositional logic]] where a variable can have either T or F values and a **truth assignment** is the assignment of values to those variables, [[1745499861 - Probabilities|Probabilities]] use an aproach where **one variable can have several values, contained inside the domain of that variable** ($\Omega$)
> Instead of having some associated value to the variable there is a **probability associated to each value that the variable can have**.

> f.e: $X \in \{1,2,3,4,\}$, with probabilities $\{0.2,0.3,0.1,0.4\}$

+ These probabilies define a **probability distribution**

> [!exercise] Dictionary: 
> +  **sample space: ($\omega$)** The domain of a random variable
> + **atomic event: (e)** A possible situation of the variable, a po
