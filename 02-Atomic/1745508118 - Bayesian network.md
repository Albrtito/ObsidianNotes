# Bayesian network
> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> A Bayesian network is a probabilistic method based on [[1745507844 - Conditional independence|Conditional independence]] that is used to obtain the probability of some state given the probability of previous states.
> It represents “graphically” the conditional independence idea, where a **previous state** will be used as the condition for the next state probability.
