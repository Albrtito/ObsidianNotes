# ADT - Stack

> [!NOTE] Intro:  
> An stack is a [[DT]] 

<aside>
ðŸ’¬ A stack is a **linear data structure** based on **LIFO (last-in, first-out).**

</aside>


## Stack methods:

- `Stack()` â†’ Creates an empty stack
- `push(e)` â†’ Adds a new element e at the top of the slack. **Returns** nothing
- `pop()` â†’ Removes and **returns** the top element of the stack.
    
    If stack is empty â†’ ERROR
    

<aside>
ðŸ’¬ **LIFO:**

The concept of the **LIFO** sytem is the following. If we imagine a lot of pieces one on top of the other. We create a tower of pieces. LIFO system creates the tower by adding pieces on the top. In this imaginary tower obviously we canÂ´t get elements that are not on top as the tower could fall. So we allways need to get the element on top if we want to remove any element

**CODE:**

In order to perform this operations in code we use the `push` and `pop` methods.

</aside>

- `top()` â†’ Returns the top element from the slack. **Does not remove it.**
    
    If stack empty â†’ ERROR
    
- `size()` â†’ Returns the number of elements in the stack
    - Like lenght for list
- `isEmpty()` â†’ **Bool value.**True if empty false if not
