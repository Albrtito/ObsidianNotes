# Subnets

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> We call subnets to small groups of connected devices inside a bigger net, this groups are by themselfs an **smaller net â†’ Subnet**. 
> This *smaller net* idea is also why subnets can be called just nets or IP networks

+ We can get the number of subnets in any given net by isolating the interfaces from its host or router. This creates islands of isolated networks (each of them count as a subnet)
+ #Duda: Pq no obtenemos una subnet para cada host? No es cierto que cada host tiene una interfaz?
## Subnet mask
The Addresses of hosts in a subnet are all **similar to each other** this similarity is given by its [[1730832772 - CIDR Notation|CIDR Notation]]. The notation used to represent the subnet is called **subnet mask**. [^1]

> f.e: The following subnet would be defined by its subnet mask:
> $$223.1.1.0/24$$
