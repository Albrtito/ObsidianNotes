# SQL DML

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Data Manipulation Language is the one in charge of changing the **contents of the objects defined previously in the [[1743006292 - SQL DDL|SQL DDL]]**. It can be used in three ways:
> 1. Directly into the SQL console
> 2. Embedded into other programming languages
> 3. Using modules
> 
> It contains **three actualization operations:**
> + Tuple insertion
> + Tuple deletion
> + Tuple modification
> And **one retrieval operator:**
> + Queries → Selection of tuples
> 

## Selection (SELECT):
The select operator **returns tuples** based on some conditions: 
```SQL
[WITH
	<symbol> AS <subquery>
	[, <symbol> AS <subquery> ...]]
]

SELECT [ALL|DISTINCT] <selection_list>
	FROM <source_clause>
	[WHERE <condition>]
	[GROUP BY <criterion> [HAVING <condition>]]
	[{UNION|UNION ALL|MINUS|INTERSECT} <query>]
	[ORDER BY <criterion> [ASC|DESC]]
;
```

**Where:**
```SQL
<selection_list> := {*|attributes|pseudo-columns| constant values | functions}
```
+ * → **wildcard** value meaning all the values of a table 
+ attributes → of the workspace relation scheme (columns of the table created in the from statement)
**Remarks:**
+ See that the `<symbol> AS <subquery>` is the SQL representation of the **renaming operator.** Because SELECT queries can take a ton of space it is usefull to give each subquery a symbol to make it all more readable and avoid errors. 
+ See that every other operator in the query also has it’s relation to Relational Algebra [[1739196838 - DB Relational dynamics|DB Relational dynamics]]
+ 

### Running order: 
The whole SELECT operator is really big and therfore to detect errors (among other things) knowing the running order of it is usefull. 
1. WITH
2. FROM 
3. WHERE 
4. GROUP BY
5. UNION | UNION ALL | MINUS | INTERSECT
6. ORDER BY
7. SELECT
This just tells us that before doing the actual select all other subqueries are performed.
