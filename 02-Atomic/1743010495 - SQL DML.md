# SQL DML

> [!NOTE] Intro: 
> Data Manipulation Language is the one in charge of changing the **contents of the objects defined previously in the [[1743006292 - SQL DDL|SQL DDL]]**. It can be used in three ways:
> 1. Directly into the SQL console
> 2. Embedded into other programming languages
> 3. Using modules
> 
> It contains **three actualization operations:**
> + Tuple insertion
> + Tuple deletion
> + Tuple modification
> And **one retrieval operator:**
> + Queries â†’ Selection of tuples
> 

## Selection (SELECT):
The select operator **returns tuples** based on some conditions: 
```SQL
[WITH
	<symbol> AS <subquery>
	[, <symbol> AS <subquery> ...]]
]

SELECT [ALL|DISTINCT] <selection_list>
	FROM <source_clause>
	[WHERE <condition>]
	[GROUP BY <criterion> [HAVING <condition>]]
	[{UNION|UNION ALL|MINUS|INTERSECT} <query>]
	[ORDER BY <criterion> [ASC|DESC]]
;
```

**Remarks:**
+ See that the `<symbol> AS <subquery>` is the SQL representation of the **renaming operator.** Because SELECT queries can take a ton of space it is usefull to give each subquery a symbol to make it all more readable and avoid errors.
