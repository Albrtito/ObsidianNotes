# The Internet Protocol (IP)
There are two versions of IP in use today, **IPv4** and **IPv6**. 

+ IP addresses are technically associated with an interface rather than with the host or router containing that interface.
+ An IP address is 32 bits long or 4 bytes
+ Addresses represented by the byte_value.byte_value.byte_value.byte_value : 192.32.216.9
+ Every internet interface **must have an IP address that is UNIQUE** 
+ We can use [[1730832772 - CIDR Notation|CIDR]] notation to reference **groups of IP addresses.**
  
  > [!ATTENTION] REMARK:
  > Really important to know about CIDR and understand what this notation means
