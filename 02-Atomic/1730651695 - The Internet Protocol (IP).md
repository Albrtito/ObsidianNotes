# The Internet Protocol (IP)
There are two versions of IP in use today, [[1730826735 - Protocol - IPv4 protocol|IPv4 protocol]] and **IPv6**. 

+ IP addresses are technically associated with an interface rather than with the host or router containing that interface.
+ Every internet interface **must have an IP address that is UNIQUE** 
+ We can use [[1730832772 - CIDR Notation|CIDR]] notation to reference **groups of IP addresses.**
  
  > [!ATTENTION] REMARK:
  > Really important to know about CIDR and understand what this notation means
