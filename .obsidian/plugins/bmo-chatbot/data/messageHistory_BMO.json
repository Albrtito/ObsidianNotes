It will automatically format the fraction for you.\n\nIf you want to customize the appearance of the fraction, such as changing the font size or style, you can wrap the `\\frac` command inside other LaTeX commands. For example:\n\n`\\text{\\small $\\frac{1}{21}$}`\n\nThis would produce a smaller-sized fraction: $\\frac{1}{21}$.",
