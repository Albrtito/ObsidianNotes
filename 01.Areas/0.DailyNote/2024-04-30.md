### Tomorrow's morning routine: 
Tomorrow starts the focus on study routine. I want to start waking up earlier as at 9 I’ll start studying. In order to achieve more time in te mornings I’ll start by waking up at 8 and going from that point forwards. It’s important for tomorrow to get out of bed. NO other things are due so my only objective is to get out of bed and have some nice breakfast. 

+ Why is this routine important? 
Because I cannot focus on doing new things and focusing my energy on anything if I haven’t worked on a basic routine and workflow I can be proud of and that serves me to build on top of it. 

+ What would benefit me from doing it?
I will start to have more energy during the days and the mornings, I will feel better about myself and how I work on my own life.
