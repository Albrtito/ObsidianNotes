# DAILY NOTE
## Thursday, June 20th, 2024

***
### Journal
#### TIME:14:40 
The objective and idea for today is to do everything as fast as possible. Do not stop in order to understand every detail but instead do it so more information and concepts are studied. I donâ€™t have the time and therefore I cannot loose any time. 
I still need however to do the rest time and everything.
