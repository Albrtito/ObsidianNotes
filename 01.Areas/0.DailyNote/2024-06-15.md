# DAILY NOTE
## Saturday, June 15th, 2024

***
### Journal
#### TIME: 11:55
Focusing on achieving all task. Once all is scheduled I just have to go on through the day. Although now thinking about the schedule maybe I’ve left out some time to actually go out and see the world. 
It may be just nice to go out after lunch. Or maybe talk with Marcos for some in between pauses.
