# DAILY NOTE
## Wednesday, June 5th, 2024

***
### Journal
#### TIME: 14:16
I’m not achieving the waking up in time. This is severely affecting my mornings. Today I did nothing at all. But is not only that but that… I just feel that I need to start doing things right now. I just need to feel like I’m regaining that lost time.

I’m proud about the no porn routine these days, day to day.
