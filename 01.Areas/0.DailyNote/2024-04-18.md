# DAILY NOTE
## Thursday, April 18th, 2024

***
### Journal
#### 13:30

I cannot but say that if I haven’t tried nothing I’ll write will take any meaning. If I don’t try to meet deadlines, try to complete what I proposed or try to do actual things I won’t be getting any good at doing them. I know that the dopamine reset of camps and long-term out of home activities help however my life is not only that, my day to day is different and I’ve never really enjoyed it. Without trying I cannot enjoy.
