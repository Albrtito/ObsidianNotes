# DAILY NOTE
## Tuesday, April 9th, 2024

***
### Journal
#### 09:29
Thoughts on an article: [Waking up early](https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-wake-up-at-5-a-m-every-day-ceb02e29c802) 
+ I really like the idea of “Have fun in the morning(when u start)”, i hadn’t really thought about doing it this way. 
+ “I have no self-control at all, so I control my environment.”
