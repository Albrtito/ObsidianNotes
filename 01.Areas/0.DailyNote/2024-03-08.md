### Today's reflections: 
I'm starting the new organisation method here in obsidian. It just hasn't been working recently, i keep finding myself at night going towards short content or porn, just because I'm used to. I need to find a way of breaking this loop ASAP.  This at least will create some clarity and some place to lay it all down and see what I'm thinking. 
I just cannot stop thinking and remembering how the first week was, not because  of a difference in work amount but the difference in motivation and ideas was huge.
