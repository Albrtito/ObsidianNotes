### Tomorrow's morning routine: 
+ Why is this routine important?
Same as last time. Regaining control of my own sleep routine is really important in order to have days in which I know the time things are gonna happen. Also starting to work on my objectives as a wayK of improving. 
+ What would benefit me from doing it?
 hope that the benefit will appear on the long run, I don’t know which benefit is it but I know that if I don’t try I wont even see it.
