# DAILY NOTE
## Tuesday, June 4th, 2024

***
### Journal
#### TIME: 11:04
Studying suele ir de la mano de wasting a ton of time in the descansos. Because it is understood as demanding, it is easier to just lay back and while ur not studying do nothing. 
Here in Marbella I’m supposed to have every second there is in a day to do anything i want. I find the series watching has been mostly unproductive and really makes it harder to sleep or to rest. Same thing with the lack of sport. 
It is hard to organise a routine but I can already use the one from karate or any other year. 
Time blocking seems to be “working”, de la mano de pomodoro timer I don’t really know if those 5 or 20 min
