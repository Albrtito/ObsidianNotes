### Tomorrow's morning routine: 
+ Why is this routine important? 
Mainly cause I have an exam. The focus is on waking up for the exam and have enough breakfast. 
+ What would benefit me from doing it?
This week is tough and with a ton of work, starting the day with energy and organisation really sets the path to follow.
