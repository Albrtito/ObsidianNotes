# DAILY NOTE
## Sunday, May 12th, 2024

***
### Journal
#### TIME: 09:42 

**Quick dump:**
My plan for the weekend was simple, as it was going to be an scout week, sleep in fuentenueva so I had not to worry about transport. This works really good when there is no one else, yesterday the night was spend with Jelen, Piñas, Pi, Trillo and Bruno and I did not have a bad time, but also not a great time. My point being that when I wanted to study and  ended up surrounded by people, I would have liked to be able to stop and go study by myself but that is so hard when ur surrounded by people that are not gonna do the same. Maybe a possible solution for it would have been to go to the library till 10, I can take a bus in and another one out. And that would have also been good for looking for the guitar, something I’ll have to do today.
