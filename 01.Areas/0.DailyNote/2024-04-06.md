### Today's reflections: 
Today I woke up late, however the important part of how I felt this morning does not lie there but in the fact that I did not know what I had to do. What I mean by that is that I hadn't planned this morning, the time I was going to wake up or the things I was going to do. When I loose control the first thing I notice is the force I have against doing the basic routine things. Basic things as shaving or brushing my teeth. Those seem like the basic ones but I loose them. If  i really start focusing on those then routines such as stating the following morning when going to bed start to make more sense.
