# DAILY NOTE
## Friday, May 17th, 2024

***
### Journal
#### TIME: 11:59
Waking up in time is not something that will happen in one day. Today I say the first improvements and that is that I actually woke up around nine. This means that my inner clock is starting to change. I also say how not only my inner clock is the one that is messed up but also me trying to stay in bed to avoid life.
