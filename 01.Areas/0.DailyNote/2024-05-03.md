# DAILY NOTE
## Friday, May 3rd, 2024

***
### Journal
#### TIME: 14:01
I’ve never been to excited about my birthday, for me it’s usually just one more day, people remember me and they congratulate me but that is not something I deeply care about, the interaction of congratulating someone is always the same and is more of a chore than anything else. I like however to meet with those I actually care about, that’s what I’m doing today. 
But today I woke up late and again, got sucked into the world of the dreams, It’s an strange sensation because If I don’t fight it I’ll usually just go to sleep again, and the dreams I have in that moment seem to have the objective of interacting with me so that I’m not aware I’m sleeping in. This morning my whole family came to sing happy birthday and I couldn’t have a response. Then Erica’s kid was here the whole morning and I din’t even care about her, well, I did care, I just did not do anything, or at least that is what I like to think. Focusing on doing again is the conclusion I’m arriving to.

I also want to try and do one of the journal prompts today from: [[Some Journaling prompts by ChatGPT|Journal Prompts]]

16. Write about a time when you felt proud of yourself.
The last time I felt proud was when I got my drivers license. Is something I worked on for a lot of time and gave it lot’s of hours of my time. I guess doing so (working repetitively on something) is the recipe for, when achieving it, being proud of yourself. I have always known that I like to have an stimuli, constant one. That is why when I’m outside and have to follow a conversation that is not mine I tend to get out an smoke or why I like high dopamine output things and sports.
