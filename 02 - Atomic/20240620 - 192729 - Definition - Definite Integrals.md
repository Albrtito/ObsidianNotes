### Definite integrals:

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> For some bounded interval \[a,b] we say that f is **integrable on \[a,b]**, this type of integral is called **definite integral or Riemann integral** of f on \[a,b]. Denoted by: 
> $$
> \int^b_a f = \int_a^b f(x) dx
> $$


**Remarks:**

 + The definite integral represents **the area below the graph of the function f(x) and above the X axis on interval \[a,b]**
 
> [!NOTE] Theorem: Continuous then integrable
> If a function f is continuous on an interval [a,b] then it is also integrable on [a,b].

**Remark:**
+ If f has discontinuities on a **FINITE amount of points inside the interval** it is still integrable on that interval.
