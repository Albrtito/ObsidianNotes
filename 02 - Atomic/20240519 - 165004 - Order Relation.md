# Order relation: 
> [!NOTE] Definition:
> A binary relation on a set V is a partial order(or an order relation) **IF:**
> + It it reflexive:  [[20240415 - 123128 - Reflexivity property|Reflexivity]]
> + It is antisymmetric: [[20240423 - 180447 - Property -Antisymmetry|Antisymmetry property]]
> + It is transitive: [[20240415 - 123134 - Transitivity property|Transitivity]]

**Remark:**
+ Order relations are **denoted by:** $\preceq$ 
+ A **partially ordered set $(V,\preceq)$** is a set equipped with an order relation
+ In a partially ordered set two elements are **comparable** if either $a \preceq b$ or $b\preceq a$ . Else they are **incomparable**
+ **IF:** any elements a and b of V are comparable then the set is **totally ordered**, also called **linear order or chain**

## Extremal elements: 
### Maximal, minimal
The extremal elements of an order relation are those such as there is no element above or below them are called **maximal and minimal elements** 
+ **Maximal element:** An element such as there is no element above it. 
+ **Minimal element:** An element such as there is no element below it. 

### Maximum, minimum
The elements such as no element is greater or smaller than them are called **maximum(or greatest)** and **minimum(or least)**. Denoted by **max(V)** and **min(V)**. 


**Remarks:**
+ These elements my not exist
+ The maximum element M of a partially ordered set A, if it exists, is **unique**. 
+ The maximum, if it exists, is also the maximal.

### Upper and lower bounds: 

**Remark:**
+ All subsets of a partially ordered set inherit the order

For a subset of a partially ordered set A, the set of all elements in A such as they are greater than any element in B is called the **major(B)**. The least of these upper elements is called the **sup(B)= min(m**
