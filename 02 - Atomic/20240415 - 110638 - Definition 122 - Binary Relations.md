> [!NOTE] Definition 122 
> A **binary relation R** between two sets V and W is a subset of the Cartesion product VxW. Points in the space VxW. 
> $$
> V \times W = \{(v,w):(v\in V)\land (w\in W)\}
> $$
> Then R is a subset of $V\times W$. 
> + The domain of this relation would be **all elements of the set V such as these elements have an image**
> $$
> Dom R = \{v \in V : (v,w)\in R \text{for some w }\in W\}
> $$
> + The image of R is the set of elements of W such as they are related to the domain of V: 
> $$
> Im R = \{w \in W: (v,w)\in R\text{for some v }\in V\}
> $$
> 

**Remarks:** 
+ This relation **could be a function** however for it to comply with the properties of functions, there can only be one element of the set W related to each of the elements of set V. 
+ These relations could also not be functions, this would mean that in a cartesian representation we would see a plane where for each value of V(the x axis) there could be more than one value of W(the y axis)

**Notation:**
+ If for a relation R, v and w are the sets related. Then we note: 
$$
(v,w)\in R 
$$
As: 
$$
vRw
$$


**Remark: What if V = W?**
