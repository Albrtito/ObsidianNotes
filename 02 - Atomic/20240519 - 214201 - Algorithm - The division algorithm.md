# The division algorithm

> [!NOTE] Division algorithm: 
> Let a and b â‰  0 be two integers. Then there exits an **unique pair** of integers q and r such that: 
> $$
> a = q \cdot b + r \space : 0\leq r\leq |b|
> $$

**Remarks:**
+ Numbers a and b are called dividend and divisor
+ r is the remainder, this remainder can be expressed with modular arithmetics as: $$r = a \mod b$$
+ The number q is the **quotient**
