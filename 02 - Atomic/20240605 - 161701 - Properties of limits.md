# Properties of limits: 

> [!NOTE] Uniqueness of the limit:
> If a limit exists, it is unique. If l and m both satisfy as the limits of f in $x_0$, then l must be equal to m: l = m

Given: 
$$
\begin{gather}
lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}f(x) = l \\\\
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0} g(x) = m
\end{gather}
$$
1. A constant can be taken out of the limit
   $$\lim _{x \rightarrow x_0}(c f(x))=c \ell, \quad if: c \in \mathbb{R}$$
2. Limit of the sum is equal to computing limits apart.
   $$\lim _{x \rightarrow x_0}(f(x)+g(x))=\ell+m$$
3. Limit of the multiplication of two functions is equal to the multiplication of the both limits.
   $$\lim _{x \rightarrow x_0}(f(x) g(x))=\ell m$$
4. Limit of the quotient of two functions is equal to the quotient of the limits
   $$\lim _{x \rightarrow x_0} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{\ell}{m}, \quad if: m \neq 0$$
