# First order, homogeneous, x/y substitution ODE

This kind of ODEs are those that can be solved by using a **change of variable**:
u → x/y or u → y/x 

## General form and solution:

All homogeneous non lineal first order ODEs have the following general form: 
$$
M(x,u) + N(x,u)u' = 0
$$

Those that can be solved with an x/y substitution must comply with the following **condition**: 
$$
\begin{gather}
{du\over dx} = u' = F(x/y) \\
\text{or}\\
{du\over dx} = u' = F(y/x) \\
\end{gather}
$$
This condition can be
