# Real variable functions: 

## Basic concepts:
Before anything else: Basic concepts and definitions of single-variable Calculus.

Real functions are defined over a domain, this domain can belong to several [[Sets of numbers]]. Each of these sets has important properties and principles.

For any of these subsets we can define [[20240603 - 112803 - Definition - Inequalities|Definition - Inequalities]] and the [[Absolute value of x]]. 
Finally, using the relation provided by inequalities [[20240603 - 113531 - Definition - Intervals|Intervals]] are defined over the set R.

## Elementary curves: 
Elementary curves are defined by basic/wellknown functions. The properties of these functions come usually in handy to solve exercises and understand more complex definitions.

The set of elementary curves that will be used during the UC3M calculus I course is:
