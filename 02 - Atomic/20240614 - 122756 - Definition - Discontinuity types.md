# Discontinuity types:

There are several types of discontinuities based on the value for the limit around the point that is being studied. 

For some point $x_0$ and function f(x):  

## Avoidable discontinuities:

Avoidable discontinuities appear if  the limit: 
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}f(x) = a
$$
But: $a \not = f(x_0)$ or $f(x)$ does not exist.

Graphically, these are expressed as a finite jump.
