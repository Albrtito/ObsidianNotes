# Separable  equations: 

> [!NOTE] Definition:  
> An equation is **separable** when we can use algebra to separate the two variables so that each is **completely on one side of the equation**

f.e: Basic eq.
	For the equation: 
	$$
	y = 2x + 1/y
	$$
	We can separe it in the following way:
	$$ 
	y - 1/y = 2x \Rightarrow 
	$$
	y’s at one side, x’s at the other
f.e: Diff eq. 
	For the DiffEq: 
	$$
	y' = x(y-1)
	$$
	Rewrite it: 
	$$
	\frac{dy}{dx} = x(y-1)
	$$
	Separe it: 
	$$
	\frac{dy}{y -1} = xdx 
	$$
	y’s at one side and x’s at the other.
