# Differentiability: 
Differentiability is defined as the capacity for a function to be differentiable.

> [!NOTE] Definition:
> We say that a function is **differentiable at a point a** if the following limit exits and is finite: 
> $$
> \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h) -f(a)}{h}
> $$
> This limit is equivalent to: 
> $$
> \lim_{x\rightarrow a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}
> $$
> 

**Remarks:**
+ If this limit exists then it is called the **derivative of f at a.** This has several notations: 
	+ **Newton’s notation:** $f’(a)$
	+ **Leibniz’s notation** $\frac{df(a)}{dx}$
+ A function can be differentiated several times. This new derivatives are called **high order derivatives of a function** and are denoted by(again, several notations, all equivalent): 
	+ **Newton’s notation:** $f’’(x), f’’’(x), …, f^{(n}(x)$ → (yes, only one parenthesis)
	  
	+ **Leibniz’s notation**: $\frac{d^nf(x)}{dx^n}$
	

## Differentiable on an interval: 

> [!NOTE] Definition:  
> We say that a function f is differentiable on an interval (a,b) if it is differentiable a all the points of (a,b).
> The points where f is differentiable are given by the **domain of f’**
