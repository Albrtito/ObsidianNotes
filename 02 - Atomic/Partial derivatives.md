For computing the partial derivatives of a function, we choose the variable we'll perform the derivative to and assume that any other variables are constants in the function. 
$$
\delta f\over \delta x
$$
This represents the partial derivative of function f over the variable x. The function of **could be such**
$$
f(x,y,z)
$$
### Example: 
$$
f(x,y) = 2x^2 + 3y^4x 
$$
Partial derivative for x
$$
{\delta f\over \delta x} = 4x + 3y^4 
$$
Partial derivative for y
$$
{\delta f\over \delta y} = 12y^3x
$$
