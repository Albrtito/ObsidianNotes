# Calculus of primitive integrals: 

This note collects methods for the calculus of primitive integrals.
Weâ€™ll take the following list of integrals as elementary primitive integrals:

## Direct integration: 
Direct integration uses the definition of the elementary primitive integrals as well as the following two properties in order to obtain the value of the integral directly from the definition: 


> [!NOTE] Theorem: Linearity of integration 
> The integral operator is lineal, thismeans that for two functions f(x) and g(x) and a constant K we have:
> $$
> \begin{align}
> &1. \int (f(x)+g(x)) dx = \int f(x) dx + \int g(x)dx \\\\
> &2. \int Kf(x)dx = K\int f(x) dx
> \end{align}
> $$
