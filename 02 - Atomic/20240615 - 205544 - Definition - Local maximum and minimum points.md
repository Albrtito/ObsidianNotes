# Local maximum / minimum point of a function: 


> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> A point $x_0$ in A is a **local maximum/minimum point** of f in A if $\exists \sigma  > 0$ such as: 
> + $x_0$ is the maximum/minimum value of f in : $A\cap(x_0 - \sigma, x_0 + \sigma)$

+ Sigma here is defining an interval in which to study the function. This is the reason we call it **local study**

To study these points we need the most important theorem: 

> [!NOTE] Theorem:
> If $x_0$ is a local maximum or a local minimum of f and f is differentiable at $x_0$, then: 
> $$
> f'(x_0) = 0
> $$
+ This means that at the local maximums and minimums there must be **no slope**
+ **CAREFUL:** The opposite is **not true**, the value of the derivative **can be 0 without it meaning that it is a max/min**
