# Exercises - Equivalence relations


## 11.4:
Let R be a relation defined on N × N, such that $(a, b)R(c, d)$ if and only if a + b = c + d. 
Show that R is an equivalence relation on N × N, and that there exists a bijection between the quotient set (N × N)/R and N.

The relation can be defined as a function f, then: 
$$
f(a,b) = a + b = c+ d = f(c,d)
$$
## 11.6: 
We define the relation R on R2 = R × (R \\ {0}) such that
$$
(a, b) \mathcal{R}(c, d) \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad a d=b c 
$$
Show that this is an equivalence relation, and obtain the quotient set $R_2/\mathbb{R}$
