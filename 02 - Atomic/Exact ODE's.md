# Order 1 exact ODE's
Exact ODEs are such as: 
$$
M(x,y) + N(x,y){dy\over dx} = 0 
$$
**Conditions:**

The **first thing to do** with exact ODEs is to check the condition: 

$$
{\delta M\over \delta y} = {\delta N \over \delta x}
$$
### Solving exact ODEs
Exact ODEs are solved once a function is found such as the [[Partial derivatives]] in x and y are equal to M and N.

$$
\Psi (x,y) \Rightarrow {\delta \Psi\over \delta x} = M(x,y) ; {\delta \Psi \over \delta y} = N(x,y)
$$
Now, how to find this function, cause it's not as if anyone thinks of this types of functions in the shower. First, let's imagine we have the function, then the solution is the representation of such function. 

**SOLUTION:**
$$
C = \Psi (x,y) 
$$
