ODEs or Ordinary Differential Equations, these equations have the following properties.
### Properties
+ **Linearity**: Describes the degree of the dependent variable (usually y). Namely: If y is not degree 1, then it's not linear
+ **Order**: The order of the highest derivative in the equation 
# Solving ODEs
[Initial value problem](Initial%20value%20problem)
When solving an ODE the first thing is to know which type of ODE it is. Based on the properties of the ODEs we'll classify based on order and linearity. 
### Order 1:
#### Linear

#### Non-Linear
