# Exercises - Modular arithmetic: 
## 12.1: 
Given a = 92 and b = 84, use Euclid’s algorithm to compute d = gcd(a, b), Find integers x, y ∈ Z such that ax + by = d.

a = 92
b = 84
1. gcd(92,84) = d => gcd(92,84) = gcd(84,8) = gcd(8,4) = gcd(4,0) = 4
$$
\begin{gather}
92 = 1\cdot 84 + 8\\
84 = 10\cdot 8 + 4\\
8 = 2 \cdot 4 + 0
\end{gather}
$$
1. Finc x, y $\in$ >; 
	+ ax + by = d
