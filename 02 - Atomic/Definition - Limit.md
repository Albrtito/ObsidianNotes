This is clearly one of the hardest definitions to understand. At leas for me. 
There's one part that is easier, the third condition. This is where the neighbourhood concept really resonates.
+ If we choose bigger and bigger values of n, they cannot get out of the neighbourhood we have created with center a and radius  epsilon. If this happens then we've found our limit. 
+ If the last thing said complies it also means that the bigger the n we get the closer it must get to a.

I'll ask for some tutoring sessions in the future for the rest of the definition. #Duda 

**Remarks:**
+ The definition of limit is based on points inside a [[20240603 - 102925 - Definition - Neighbourhoods|Neighbourhoods]]
