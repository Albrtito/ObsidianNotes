# Limit: 
This note tries to explain the proper (formal) definition of limit, even if I cannot even begin to comprehend it. #Duda 


> [!NOTE] Definition:
> **We say that the function f TENDS TO THE LIMIT l** IF when x approaches $x_0$ f approaches l. 
This is written: 
>$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}f(x) = l
>$$
>
>**Formally** this is written as: **IF**: 
>+ $\forall \epsilon > 0$ 
>+ $\exists \sigma > 0$
>+ $|f(x) - l| < \epsilon$
>
>
>**Satisfying**: 
>  + $0<|x-x_0| < \sigma$

**Remarks:**
 In order to prove this last part 


This means that we **do not care** about the values of f far from x = $x_0$ , only the ones close to it. 



**Remarks:**
+ The definition of limit is based on points inside a [[20240603 - 102925 - Definition - Neighbourhoods|Neighbourhoods]]
