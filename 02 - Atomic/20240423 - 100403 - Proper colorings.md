# Proper colorings
Discrete mathematics has a whole branch of people coloring graphs in different ways. Given some rules, is it possible to color de graph?

In this whole field of investigation a term for coloring a graph in a distinctive way has been created: **Proper colorings**. Then, coloring a graph in the proper way **means that no two adjacent vertices will have the same colour.** This could seem arbitrary at first, however it has applications such as the widely spread sudoku game. It can also be applied to create group schedules or rotations.

For graph colorings there are two main theorems, the chromatic polynomial and the contraction-deletion theorem.
