# Dijkstra’s algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to **find the shortest path that joins an initial vertex s to a final vertex t** given the following conditions: 
+ The graph must be simple
+ The graph must be connected and weighted such as **all weights are positive**
$$
G = (V,E,w): (w_e >0 , \forall e\in E)
$$
The basic idea:
