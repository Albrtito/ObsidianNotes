# Prime numbers: 

> [!NOTE] Definition:  
> A natural number p > 1 is called a **prime number** if the only possible factors of p are 1 and p. A natural number p >1 that is not prime is called **composite**

**Remarks:** The natural number 1 **is not prime**. The first prime number is 2 and the other prime numbers are odd natural numbers(if else they would be divisible by 2).

## Composite numbers: 
Composite numbers are those that are not prime. Any number that is not prime is a composite. They can be defined in the following way:

> [!NOTE] Composite numbers 
> The positive integer n is a composite number if and only if n can be divided by some prime number p ≤ $\sqrt{n}$
