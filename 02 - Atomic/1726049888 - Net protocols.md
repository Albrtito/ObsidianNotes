# Net protocols
When sending packages though the internet computers need to understand one another. This means **encoding the packages in the same way** as the one receiving them.
+ The [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) defines public standard protocols.
**Remarks:**
+ Most protocols are public (TCP,IP) although anyone can develop a private protocol.

> [!NOTE] Definition(Kurose): 
> A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.
