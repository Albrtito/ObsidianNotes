# Initial Value Problem (IVP):

When we are given a [[20240208 - 000000 - Definition - Differential Equations|Differential Equations]] **along with some initial conditions** we have an initial value problem.

**Remark:**
Initial conditions are specific values given to the function represented in the DE and it’s derivatives for some value of it’s independent variables. 

f.e: 
	Given the differential equation: 
	$$
	x'' = 2t
	$$
	And initial conditions: 
	$$
	x(1) = 1; x'(1) = 2
	$$
	We first obtain the **general solution of the DE**: For this example is given: 
	$$
	x(t) = \frac{t^3}{3} + c_1t + c_3
	$$
	And then we use the initial conditions to find both constants:
