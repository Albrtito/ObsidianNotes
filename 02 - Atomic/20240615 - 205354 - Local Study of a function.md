# Local study of a function:
Studying a function and it’s properties is usually divided into different areas. 

1. Study of the [[20240616 - 155905 - Extrema|Extrema]], all the weird and interesting points that we can find, places where the function is not easily readable. 
   From this study we obtain: 
   + [[20240615 - 205544 - Definition - Local maximum and minimum points of a function|Local maximum and minimum points of a function]]
   + Location of asymptotes

2. Study of the convexity of the function and it’s **inflection points**. 
   See: [[20240616 - 162016 - Convexity of a function|Convexity of a function]]
   From this study we obtain: 
   + Intervals of convexity of the function 
   + Inflexion points
     
 3. Study of the [[20240616 - 162755 - Definition - Asymptotes|Asymptotes]] of the function. 
    From this study we obtain: 
    + Position of the horizonal asymptotes
    + Position of the vertical asymptotes
    + Position of the oblique asymptotes
