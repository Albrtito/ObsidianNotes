# Files: 
**Remember:** The architecture of almost all systems sets a division between the **main memory** and the **secondary memory**. 
+ Main memory is the one used to store non-persistent data, data that is only accessed directly by the processor. 
+ The secondary memory is non-volatile, this means that the data is actually stored there, when we talk about the data we have store in a computer we are talking about this secondary memory. This memory is divided in data blocks, to divide the memory we use an abstraction, this abstraction we call **files**

We can say that a file is no more than a byte block.
