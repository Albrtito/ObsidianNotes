# Files: 
**Remember:** The architecture of almost all systems sets a division between the **main memory** and the **secondary memory**. 
+ Main memory is the one used to store non-persistent data, data that is only accessed directly by the processor. 
+ The secondary memory is non-volatile, this means that the data is actually stored there, when we talk about the data we have store in a computer we are talking about this secondary memory. This memory is divided in data blocks, to divide the memory we use an abstraction, this abstraction we call **files**

We can say that a file is no more than a byte block. 

## What is a file system?
A file system offers the user a logical view for handling peripheral devices n form of files. It hides the details that do not interest to an user. It has the following functions: 
+ Organization 
+ storage
+ Retrieval
+ Name management
+ Implement co-utilisation semantics
+ Protection 

### Views of the file system:
The logical view contains: **Files, Directories, File systems and partitions**
The physical view contains: **Blocks of bytes placed in 
devices (storages of data)**

### Features for users: 
Permanent sotrage of information
Logic structure for info
Logical and structured names
No application controls it
Abstract physical storage devices
Accessed through OS system calls or utility libraries

## File attributes: 
A file can have several attributes: 
+ Name: Readable format
+ Identifier: 
+ File type: 
+ Location:
