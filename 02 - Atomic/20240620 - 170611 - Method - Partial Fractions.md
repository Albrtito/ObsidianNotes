# Partial fractions:
The partial fraction method is used to **decompose**fractions into **sums of simpler** rational functions. The objective is to rewrite expressions such as: 
$$
\frac{3x}{x^2 -x -2}
$$
by partitioning them into smaller fractions based on the decomposition of the denominator by it’s rots. For the previous example we would obtain something such as: 
$$
\frac{1}{x +1} + \frac{2}{x -2}
$$
## Method:

**CONDITION:**
This method is used for fractions such as: 
$$
\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
$$
There are two variations of the method:

There’ll be two different possibilities whether: 
1.  $\deg(P(x)) < \deg(Q(x))$ 
2. $\deg(P(x)) > \deg(Q(x))$ 

### For P(x) < Q(x)
Perform
