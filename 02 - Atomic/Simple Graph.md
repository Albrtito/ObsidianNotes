A simple graph is such as there are **no loops, no multiedges**
### Simple graph families: 
All of these graphs can be represented with n vertices. 
$K_n$ : [[Complete graph]]
$P_n$: [[Path graph]]
$C_n$: [[Cycle graph]]
$W_n$: [[Wheel graph]]
	**Remark:** This graph has n + 1 vertices. (the center one does not count into the n)
$K_{n,m}$ :[[Complete bipartite graph]]
$Q_n$: [[The n-cube graphs]]
**Remark:** We call **trivial graph** to a graph that contains no edges but some vertices.
