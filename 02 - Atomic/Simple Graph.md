A simple graph is such as there are **no loops, no multiedges**
### Simple graph families: 
All of these graphs can be represented with n vertices. 
$K_n$ : [Complete graph](Complete%20graph.md)
$P_n$: [Path graph](Path%20graph)
$C_n$: [Cycle graph](Cycle%20graph)
$W_n$: [Wheel graph](Wheel%20graph)
	**Remark:** This graph has n + 1 vertices. (the center one does not count into the n)
$K_{n,m}$ :[Complete bipartite graph](Complete%20bipartite%20graph)
$Q_n$: [The n-cube graphs](The%20n-cube%20graphs.md)
**Remark:** We call **trivial graph** to a graph that contains no edges but some vertices.
