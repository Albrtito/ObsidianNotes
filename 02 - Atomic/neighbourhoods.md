# Intro
Neighbourhoods are used to define the concept of 'proximity'. They allow to know which real numbers are the closest to a given one based on some parameter. 
Is like drawing a circle from once chosen one middle point for it, then looking for all values that are inside that circle.

> [!NOTE] Definition 4:  Open neighbourhood
> An open neighbourhood with center $x_0$ and radius $\epsilon > 0$ is defined as: 
$$
\begin{gathered}
E(x_0;\epsilon) =\{x \in R : |x-x_o| < \epsilon\} \\ \text{see figure below}
\end {gathered}
$$
