# Exercises - Limits

## 1. Use the $\varepsilon - {\delta}$  definition of limit: 
#Duda Como se hace esto? No entiendo

## 2. Common factor: 
### 2.1: UseÂ [[20240606 - 181806 - Notable Identities#($a n - b n)| Notable identity]]

### 2.3: Apply a change of variable:With different exponent roots this is a good method. 

#Duda : Can it be done simply by multiplying by the conjugate?

### 2.5: Use [[20240515 - 013001 - Theorem - Newton's binomial theorem|Newton's binomial theorem]] 
#Duda HOW?

### 2.6: Apply the conjugate (With three terms, just swap the sign of the root)


## 3. Using: $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$ and $\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{e^x -1}{x} = 1$

### 3.1: Use a change of variable in order to separe the function: $t = 2x^3$

### 3.2: Conjugate to have something else than x squared down. Then use the trigonometric relation $sin^2 + cos^2 = 1$ up with the 1. 

### 3.3: This relation (the one defined above: [[#3. Using $ lim_{x rightarrow 0} frac{sin x}{x} = 1$ and $ lim_{x rightarrow 0} frac{e x -1}{x} = 1$|This one]]) is true for x. As long as x is equal everywhere the rest does not matter, so if: 

#Duda : Sure about this?
$$
lim_{x\rightarrow 0} \frac{sin (x^2)}{x^2} = 1
$$
+ With a change of variable we can directly see. Because it tends to 0. Does not matter there the change of variable and we can directly do t = $x^2$ 
### 3.5: Perform a **change of variable** : 
$$y = log(1 +x)$$
Take into account that then: 
$$
e^y = e^{ln(1 +x )} \Rightarrow e^y = 1 + x \Rightarrow x = e^y -1
$$

### 3.6: This is a direct limit of to e when x tends to 0, see:[[20240606 - 220121 - Exponential limit forms|Exponential limit forms]]

### 3.7: Apply Taylor? #Duda  How to do it without Taylor?
