# DNS

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> DNS is an internet **distributed database application** that the **whole network needs to work**.
>  It transforms the name of a page in the internet(humanly readable text)  into the brute ip addres (an string of numbers that wont make any sense to humans). 
>  $$
>   \text{myWebPage.com} \rightarrow 97.345.321.342
>   $$

+ We say this is an **application-layer protocol** 
+ **Maps between IP address and name**

## Structure: 
The DNS database follows a decentralized structure in order to **prevent an internet crisis if volume increases** and prevent having a **single point of failure**.

When someone requests a page to the DNS service, their computer will search for it recursively in different servers, starting with the local one. Once the query is not fount in a server it goes one level up and asks for it to the next (bigger) server. 

**ask local server → ask national server → ask root server → ask TLD server → ask authoritative server**
