# Application layer

> [!Quote] Remember: 
> In any network, the aplicatinos that send messages through the network are called **distributed**. 

The **architecture of the application can be one of two types:**

Server - Client
1. **Server:** Where some common info is. It has a permanent place (permanent IP) and sends info to all the clients. 
2. **Clients:** The clients communicate with the server and not with each other. Do not need to be connected all the time

Peer-Peer
