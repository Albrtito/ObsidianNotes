# Ordinary Differential Equations: 

ODEs or Ordinary Differential Equations are those differential equations such as the target function (solution) does only depend on **one independent variable**: 

f.e: $f(x) = 2f(x)' + x$

### Properties
+ **Linearity**: Describes the degree of the dependent variable (usually y). Namely: If y is not degree 1, then it's not linear
+ **Order**: The order of the highest derivative in the equation

## Types ODEs

Classification of types is done by order and linearity. 

### First order ODEs:
#### Linear:
+ [[20240528 - 121302 - First order, Linear  ODE|First order, Linear  ODE]]

#### Non-Linear: 

+ [[20240528 - 110528 - Separable ODEs|Separable ODEs]]
+ [[20240529 - 162512 - First order, exact ODE|Exact ODE]]
+ [[20240529 - 180146 - First order, homogeneous, substitutions ODEs|Homogeneous, substitutions ODEs]]
