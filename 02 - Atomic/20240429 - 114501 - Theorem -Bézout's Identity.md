> [!NOTE] Theorem:
> IF a and b are: 
> + Two integers
> + Not simultaneously zero
> **THEN:**
> Exists integers u and w such that: 
> $$ 
> gcd(a,b)= a \cdot u + b\cdot w
> $$

**Remarks:**
+ The proof of this theorem is given by “unrolling” the steps of [[20240519 - 233523 - Algorithm - Euclid's algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]].

+ The Bézout’s identity does **not imply that the integers u and v are unique**
