# Counting methods: 
When computing the possibilities of some event A happening weâ€™ll encounter different types of restrictions for A. Based on these restrictions we can categorise different counting methods to compute the number of possibilities (or cardinality) of some A.
This event A is usually the possibilities 



> [!NOTE] Proposition 23: Ordered subsets
> Instead of just substracting one (like in permutations) and using the factorial to compute it, now there are **an specific number of spots to arrange the elements**. 
Subtract one until there are no more spots left
>
+ Formula: Compute the permutation and delete the unwanted spots
$$
n!\over (n-r)!
$$
	**r: The number of spots to arrange** 
		+ Specify where to stop


+ **Allowing repetitions**: If two elements can repeat, then no need of subtracting one each time, just multiply by the number of elements in the set the number of times equal to the spots u have. This means. 
$$
n^r

$$
\binom {n}{r} = {n!\over r!(n-r)!}

The [Pascal's triangle](Pascal's%20triangle.md) represents the number of possible subsets for different size's of sets.
