Some useful things about the theorem: 
+ For any graph , the sum of all the vertex degrees has to be even. (an edge after all needs two attach points)
+ Any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree
+ For a graph with an odd number of vertices, there's an odd number of vertices of even degree
