# Integration in one variable: 
Collection of notes and concepts about the computation of integrals in one variable calculus. 

The first thing to see is how to compute the value of the primitive integrals and all the methods that we can use to do so. These methods are collected in the following note:

The computation of integrals can be done without any knowledge of what actually is an integral. In order to understand that concept we need to explain what the **fundamental theorem of calculus** is: 

## Fundamental theorem of calculus:
Before advancing into the theorem some definitions must be given. These definitions will conclude in the explanation about what is an integral. 

### The area below a function:
Given some function f(x), **the area below it** can be approximated with some number of rectangles. Even if the function is curved we can try and fit rectangles inside of it. 
Computing the area of those rectangles is easy (height times base) and therefore if we could somehow have **infinitely many rectangles** that approximated to the function really tightly it would give us a really good approximation of the area below that function. 

This idea is exactly what the definite integrals are all about.
