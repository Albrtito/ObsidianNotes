# Properties: 
+ Symmetric due to the  nature of [Binomial coefficients](Binomial%20coefficients.md) and their computation. 
$$
\binom {n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}
$$
+ Also related with [Newton's Binomial Theorem](Newton's%20Binomial%20Theorem.md)
+

# Uses in combinatorics: 
Representation of the possible subsets created. The size of the set is represented in by each of the lines.
