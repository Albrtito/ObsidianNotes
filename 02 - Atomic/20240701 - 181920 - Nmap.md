# Nmap
Nmap is a **network analysis and security auditing tool**
+ Written in C, C++, Python and Lua

Useful to scan and understand how a network is wired up. 
+ **Documentation can be found [here](https://nmap.org/)**
## Output:
The output of nmap will consist of a list of scanned targets. Each port scanned is classified inside the **interesting ports table** where it is **given an state that can vary between:**
### Port states: 
+ **open**: Some app is listening
+ **filtered**: Something is blocking, cannot tell
+ **closed**: No app listening
+ **unfiltered**: Responsive port, however cannot tell if open or closed
+ **open|filtered** or **closed|filtered**: Cannot determine between the two states

## Target specification: 
Any thing that is not an option or argument is taken as a host specification (target). This target can be given as a hostname or directly as the IP address. 
+ **Hostname:** Solved with DNS, if more than one IP at the other side takes only the first unless specified with **–resolve-all**
+ **IP:** One ip or use some style:
	+ **CIDR-style** to specify all IPs within some interval: [[20240820 - 191156 - CIDR-notation for IPs|CIDR notation]]
		**f.e**: Use `192.168.10.0/24` to scan all 256 host between 192.168.10.0 and 192.168.10.255. 
	+ **Comma-style** to skip some ip in between. 
		**f.e:** ``192.168.3-5,7.1` will scan the four addresses 192.168.3.1, 192.168.4.1, 192.168.5.1, and 192.168.7.1`

# Flags: 
+ **Get input targets from a list:** Use the option `-iL`. This list can be in the formats specified above
+ **Get random targets:** Use the `-iR` option. 
+ **Storing the results in all formats under a given name:** Use `-oA <name>`
