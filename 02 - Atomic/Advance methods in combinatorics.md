We've already seen [[ElementaryCombinatorics]] and all the methods that are used such as ordered subsets, subsets, permutations, etc. This note defines other advanced methods that can also be used in combinatorics. There'll be some explanation of the methods as theory (they are not only used for combinatorics), after that the specific uses and cases in combinatorics will be defined. 

1. [[Recurrence relations]]
2. [[Generating functions]]
