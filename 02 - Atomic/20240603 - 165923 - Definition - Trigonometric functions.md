# Trigonometric functions:
## sin / cos:
There are two main trigonometric functions, all other can be derived from these ones. 
$$
\begin{gather}
f(x) = sin(x)\\
and\\
f(x) = cos (x)
\end{gather}
$$

+ Arguments from this functions are always given **in radians**. 
**Remarks:**

+ In **radiants** to degrees:

	+ Any multiple of $\pi/2$ is multiple of 90ยบ
	+ Any multiple of $\pi/4$ is a multiple of 45ยบ
	+ Any multiples of $\pi/3$ and $\pi/6$ are multiples of 60ยบ and 30ยบ respectively.

## Derived functions:
Those functions that can be derived from the basic sin and cos, with their respective graphs, are: 

$$
tan(x) = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
$$

$$
cotg(x) = \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
$$

$$\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos x}$$
$$cosec (x) = \frac{1}{sin(x)}$$

## Trigonometric relations:
All trigonometric functions are related in several ways, these relations are compiled in the following note:
