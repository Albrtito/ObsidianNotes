There are two main trigonometric functions, all other can be derived from these ones. 
$$
\begin{gather}
f(x) = sin(x)\\
and\\
f(x) = cos (x)
\end{gather}
$$

Arguments from this functions are always given **in radians**. Those functions that can be derived from them are: 
$$
\begin{gather}
tan(x) = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\\\\
cotg(x) = \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\\\\
\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos x}\\\\
cosec (x) = \frac{1}{}

\end{gather}
$$
