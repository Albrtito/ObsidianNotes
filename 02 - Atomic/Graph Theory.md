[[PsedoGraph]]
[[Simple Graph]]
### Definitions: 

> [!NOTE] [[The Handshaking Theorem]]
> Useful to obtain the cardinality of the edge set in a [[PsedoGraph]]. Basic formula is: 
$$
> \sum_{v\in V}d (v) = 2|E|
$$

> [!NOTE] [[Bipartite graph]]
> Useful for [[colorings]]. 


> [!NOTE] [[Subgraph]]
The subgraph has all it's sets as subsets of the graph it is subgraph of. A [[spanning subgraph]] is defined as the graph that contains the same vertices as the original graph but a subset of edges.

> [!NOTE] [[Adjacency matrix]]
> The adjacency matrix is used to represent the connections of a graph in a matrix. 

> [!NOTE] [[Graph Isomorphism]]
> Useful to compare two graphs that are graphically different but represent the same. 


> [!NOTE] [[Walks in a graph]]
