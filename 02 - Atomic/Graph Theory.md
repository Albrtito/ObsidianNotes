### Definitions: 

> [!NOTE](The%20Handshaking%20Theorem.md)
> Useful to obtain the cardinality of the edge set in a [PsedoGraph](PsedoGraph.md). Basic formula is: 
$$
> \sum_{v\in V}d (v) = 2|E|
$$

> [!NOTE](Bipartite%20graph.md)
> Useful for [colorings](colorings). 


> [!NOTE](Subgraph.md)
The subgraph has all it's sets as subsets of the graph it is subgraph of. A [spanning subgraph](spanning%20subgraph) is defined as the graph that contains the same vertices as the original graph but a subset of edges.

> [!NOTE](Adjacency%20matrix)
> The adjacency matrix is used to represent the connections of a graph in a matrix. 

> [!NOTE](Graph%20Isomorphism.md)
> Useful to compare two graphs that are graphically different but represent the same.
