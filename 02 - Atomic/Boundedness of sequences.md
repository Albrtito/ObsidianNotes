When all terms of a sequence of real numbers constitute a set in R we can say that the **sequence is bounded**.  The definition of a bounded set was already explained on [Boundedness](Boundedness.md), this can be of some use. 

![Definition 11 Bounded sequence](Definition%2011%20Bounded%20sequence.md)

![Definition 12 Sequence NOT BOUNDED from above or below](Definition%2012%20Sequence%20NOT%20BOUNDED%20from%20above%20or%20below.md)
