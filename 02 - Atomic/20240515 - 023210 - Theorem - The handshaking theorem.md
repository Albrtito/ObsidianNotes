> [!theom] Theorem: Handshaking theorem
> For any **undirected graph** G = (V,E) we have that:

**Remarks:**
Some useful things about the theorem: 
+ For any graph , the sum of all the vertex degrees has to be even. (an edge after all needs two attach points)
+ Any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree
+ For a graph with an odd number of vertices, there's an odd number of vertices of even degree
