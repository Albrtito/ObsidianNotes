When solving DEs, there is a chance that the Differential Equation expression is not valid for some value of y when using some method to obtain a solution to the DE.

For example, if we have the following separable ODE: 
$$
\frac{dy}{(1-y)^2} = 2x dx
$$
+ We know that y â‰  1 not to divide by 0. 
Then, at the end of the
