# Multiplicative inverse of x in modular arithmetics: 


> [!NOTE] Definition: Multiplicative inverse 
> The multiplicative inverse y of an integer x in $Z_m$ is such as: 
> $$
> x \cdot y = 1 \mod m
> $$

**Remarks:**
+ In modular arithmetics, there **does not exist in general** the multiplicative inverse of an integer x.
