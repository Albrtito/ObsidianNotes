+ A function with two variables is represented in the following way: 
$$
f(x,y)
$$
+ The graph of a function of such sort is in one dimension more than the number of inputs it takes. They are surfaces and other geometrical representations of such sort
+ In order to compute the derivative of a function with two variables we use [[Partial derivatives]]
