# Asymptotes: 

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> An asymptote of a function f as $x\rightarrow \infty / -\infty$ is another function g such as: 
> $$
> \lim_{x\rightarrow \infty / -\infty}(f(x) - g(x)) = 0
> $$ 

During the #CalcI weâ€™ll only study asymptotes that are **straight lines**. 
These straight lines can be in three orientations: Vertical, Horizontal or oblique. 

1. **Vertical asymptotes:** Are those found when **any of the side** limits of the function at $x_0$ is infinite. 
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0^{+/-}} f(x) = \pm \infty
$$

2. **Horizontal asymptotes:** Are those found when **the limit when the function tends to infty/- infty is a finite real number**
$$
\lim_{x\rightarrow \pm \infty} f(x) = a
$$

3. **Oblique asymptote or Slant asymptote**: Are those found when **the limit when f tends to infty/-infty is a line: $y = mx **
