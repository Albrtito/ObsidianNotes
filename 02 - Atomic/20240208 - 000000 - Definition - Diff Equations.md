# Differential equations:

Differential equations are **relations between a function and its derivatives**
f.e: 
	The following differential equation states a relation between x(t) and its derivatives:
	$$
	x'' + 8x' + 7x = 0
	$$
	Where $x’’$ is the second derivative of x and $x’$ is the first derivative of x. 

When **solving a differential equation** the **objective is to find the function that satisfies the equation.** 
+ The solution is a function
## ODEs and PDEs
When analysing a differential equation, the resulting function we find can be of two types: 
Lets say that the function is f()
1. IF the function **only depends on one independent variable**: $f(x)$. Then the differential equation is an **Ordinary Differential Equation** or [[ODEs]].
   And the derivatives of f(x) are **ordinary derivatives**
   
2. IF the function **depends on more than one independent variable:** $f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$. 
   Then the differential equation is a **Partial Differential Equation** or [[20240418 - 193416 - Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)|PDEs]]
   The derivatives of $f(x_1,x_2,…,x_n)$ are partial derivatives. 
   
## Properties:

Differential equations appear everywhere. The thing is that most of the times the equation cannot be solved or is too complex to solve. During the differential calculus course the focus is on finding solutions using **analytical methods**. 
The diff equations that can be solved analytical are few, in most of the cases **numeric methods** are used with the help of some computing power.

+ Appear when it's **easier to describe change than absolute amounts**
+ There are two types of diffEquations. [ODEs](ODEs.md) (Ordinary differential equations) and [PDEs](PDEs) (Partial differential equations)
+ It is important to do a quick notice to [The essentials of two variable calculus](The%20essentials%20of%20two%20variable%20calculus.md)
