# Concurrency and synchronisation. 
Once known the concepts and ways of working of processes we can start to care about how different processes and threads interact with one another. This interaction and the problem it brings is called concurrency. We’ll see what happens if two processes want to access the same resource at the same time.What if a process needs to always run before another one? We’ll understand and find solutions for these problems.
