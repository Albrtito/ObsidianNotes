Differential equations appear everywhere. The thing is that most of the times the equation cannot be solved or is too complex to solve. During the differential calculus course the focus is on finding solutions using **analytical methods**. 
The diff equations that can be solved analytical are few, in most of the cases **numeric methods** are used with the help of some computing power.

+ Appear when it's **easier to describe change than absolute amounts**
+ There are two types of diffEquations. [[ODEs]] (Ordinary differential equations) and [[PDEs]] (Partial differential equations)
+ It is important to do a quick notice to [[The essentials of two variable calculus]]
