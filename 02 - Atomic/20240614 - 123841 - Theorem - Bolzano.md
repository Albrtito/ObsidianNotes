This theorem is kind of a duh once explained. It is basically saying that if two points up and down from the y = 0 horizontal line are inside a continuity interval, then there must be a point where the line is crossed. 

This theorem also has applications when we wanna prove that the function crosses any point in between.

**Remarks:**
+ The continuity in a **closed interval** is needed.
  
+ As mentioned above, we obtain a new consequence. The **intermediate values theorem:**
  
> [!NOTE] Intermediate values theorem:
> If f is continuous and follows the Bolzano theorem. Then for any $y \in (f(a), f(b))$ there exists c$\in (a,b)$ such that f(c) = y. This means that if we have the continuity, then all values of y between those need to appear. This is both valid with  (a > 0 and b < 0) and (a < 0 and b > 0)

+ This can also be used to state boundedness:
