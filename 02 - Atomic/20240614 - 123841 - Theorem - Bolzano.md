This theorem is kind of a duh once explained. It is basically saying that if two points up and down from the y = 0 horizontal line are inside a continuity interval, then there must be a point where the line is crossed. 

This theorem also has applications when we wanna prove that the function crosses any point in between.

> If f is continuous on [a,b] and f(a)f(b) < 0 (meaning one of them is negative).

> Then there exist a point c $\in (a,b)$ such that: $f(c) = 0$


**Remarks:**
+ The continuity in a **closed interval** is needed.
