# Semantic theory in predicates: 

It is similar to the semantic theory in propositional calculus, however there is higher complexity on the interpretation required. 

## Evaluation of formulas:

**Remember:** In propositional calculus we have: 
+ Constants: Specific elements of the domain 
+ Variables: Assign to any element of the domain 
	+ Free variables
	+ Quantified variables
+ Functions: Assigns to specific applications, transformations between the elements of the domain. 

For each predicate an specific relation (n-ary) in the domain of reference is assigned. Predicates can not be true or false like propositions so the case **needs to tell us the values of the predicates for each element (or group of elements) in the domain.** 

f.e: 
	 For a domain D = {a,b} and the predicates P(x) and Q(x) the following table needs to be given.

If we start adding all the possible elements there are in predicate calculus we see that each and every one of them needs a given truth table. All of them: Functions,Prepositions, free variables and constants. This makes it so with only one
