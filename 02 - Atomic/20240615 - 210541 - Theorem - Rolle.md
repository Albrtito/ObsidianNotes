# Existence of a maximum and minimum, Rolle: 

> [!NOTE]  Theorem: Rolle
> If f is **continuous on [a,b]** and **differentiable on (a,b)**. And **f(a) = f(b)**. 
> Then there is some c $\in (a,b)$ such that: 
> $$
> f'(c) = 0
> $$
> 

**Remarks:**
 + If a and b are at the same “height”, then all changes in between must contain a maximum and a minimum. The derivative must vanish there. 
 + There can be several points that comply with the properties matching for c. 
 + See that the interval for continuity is closed while the one for differentiability is open
