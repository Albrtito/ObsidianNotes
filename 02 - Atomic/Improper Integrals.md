> [!NOTE] Theorem
> An improper integral is always of the form: 
$$
> \int_a^\inf h(t)dt = lim_{A\rightarrow \inf} \int_a^A h(t) dt
$$

+ Integral can go to 0, inf, a number, or nowhere

> [!NOTE] Theorem 
> If the integral $\int_a^A h(t) dt$ exist for each a, A>a and the limit also exist, the improper integral **converges**
