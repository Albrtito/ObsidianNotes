# Greatest common divisor (g.d.c.)

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> Let a and b be integers, not both simultaneously zero. 
> 
> The **largest integer d such as:**
>$$
 \begin{gather}
 d | a \\ \\
 d | b
\end{gather}
>$$
>is called the **greatest common divisor of a and b**. Denoted by: 
>$$
>\gcd(a,b)
>$$

**Remarks:**
+ The case a = b = 0 is excluded as any integer divides 0
+ gcd(0,**a**) = |a| for every nonzero integer a. 
+ **The greatest common divisor of any two numbers is UNIQUE**
