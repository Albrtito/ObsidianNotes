# Definition - Continuity of a single var function

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> A function f(x) is **continuous at $x_0$** if: 
> $$
> lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}f(x) = f(x_0)

## Properties of continuity:
Given f and g continuous at $x_0$ we define the functions as continuous or not (at point $x_0$)
1. $f + g$ is **continuous** 
2. $f\cdot g$ is **continuous**
3. **If:** $g(x) \not = 0$ : $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} is **continuous**
   
4. **If:** g is continuous at f($x_0$) then: 
   $$
   \boxed{lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}g(f(x)) = g(\lim_{x\rightarrow x_0}f(x))}
   $$
