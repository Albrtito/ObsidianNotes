> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> A sequence is bounded (from both above and below) if if there exist a real number k such that: 
> $$
> |a_n| <= k ,\forall n\in N
> $$

**Remarks;**
+ For this definition a single number k is given. It is true that this sequence can have an upper bound and a lower bound, both as different numbers. However as we have already seen in [[Subsets of  R, Bounds, Supremum, m√°ximum, infimum, minimum]] the upper and lower bounds are such whenever every element of the sequence is greater or lower. So we can just have one single number that complies with both for a simpler definition.
