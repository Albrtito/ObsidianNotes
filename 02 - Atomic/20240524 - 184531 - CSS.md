# CSS: 
CSS is used to **style** HTML content. In order to do so each CSS statement has a **basic syntax** with an structure similar to the following: 
## CSS Syntax:

```css 
div.bold-text{
	font-weight: 700;
}
```

This has the following elements: 
+ `div.bold-text`: Is a **selector**
+ `font-weight`: IS a **property**
+ `700` : Is the **value of the property**

This structure repeats on and on. We choose the type of element we want to alter and for each of itâ€™s properties we specify a value. 

### Selectors: 
There are a lot of different selectors, the main ones are: 

**Universal selector:** The universal selector changes properties from elements of **any type**
