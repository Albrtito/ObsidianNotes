# Logarithm: 

The logarithm of x with base a is defined as:
$$
\boxed{a^b = x \Leftrightarrow log_a x = b}
$$

Logarithms are widely used in mathematics for several applications such as transformation of data or function plotting. 
However one particular base is particularly interesting, almost all used algorithms have this base, base e.
