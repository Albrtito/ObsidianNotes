> [!NOTE] Permutations
> For basic permutations, we are asked to order elements 
> + **In no specific number of spots** (as many spots as elements)
> + **With no repetitions, an element can only be used once**
> + All elements are different or namely, repetitions are allowed

> Then the **idea** is to “place” one object and subtract one from the cardinality of the set that is being ordered.

> **Result:**
> + Just use the factorial for basic permutations

f.e: 
	If we had 5 elements then we’ll see the possibilities of combinations of the 5 


+ **Permutations with repetitions:** For repeated elements in a set the arrangements cannot repeat. Those repeated arrangements have to be deleted. 
  To delete the repeated arrangements divide by the number of those repeated arrangements. The number is computed as a normal permutations (with the factorial). The final formula is: 
$$
  \binom{n!}{n_1!...n_k!} = {n! \over n_1!...n_k! }
$$
