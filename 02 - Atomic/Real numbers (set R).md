# Intro: 
The set of real numbers is indicated by the letter R. This set is the union of the rational and irrational sets. R contains all numbers defined in [[Natural numbers (set N)]][[Integer numbers (set Z)]][[Rational and irrational numbers(set Q and I)]]. 

+ Real numbers can be represented as points in the real line. 
+ When representing real numbers the whole line is filled up with them. (continuous space)

# Properties: 
## 1.  R is a completely ordered set
The set R increases. Given two real numbers either one is bigger than the other or they are equal.
## 2. ![[Absolute value of x]]
## 3. ![[Intervals]]
## 4. ![[neighbourhoods]]
## 5. ![[Subsets of  R, Bounds, Supremum, mÃ¡ximum, infimum, minimum]]
