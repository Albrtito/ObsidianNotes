> [!NOTE] Binomial coefficients
> **Conditions:**
For all non-negative integers n,r $\in Z_+$ such that 0≤ r ≤ n we define the binomial coefficient as following: 
>$$
>\binom {n}{r} = {n!\over r!(n-r)!}
>$$


**Remarks:**
+ With $\binom {n}{r} = 0$ if k<0 or k>n
+ There is an equivalence relation between the [[Pascal's triangle]] and binomial coefficients.
