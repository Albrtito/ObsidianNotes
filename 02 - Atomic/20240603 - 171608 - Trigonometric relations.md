Trigonometric relations are those that connect trigonometric functions between them. 
Really useful to reformulate some functions or statements to solve exercises, derivations, etc.


1. Everything squared is one
$$
\boxed{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1}
$$

**TWO X’s INSTEAD OF ONE X**
2. Sin of 2x? 2 times both
$$
\boxed{\sin(2x) = 2 \sin(x) \cos(x)}
$$
3. Cos of 2x? Subtract the squares…first the cosine
$$
\boxed{cos(2x) = cos^2(x)- sin^2(x)}
$$
4. Tan of 2x? 
$$
\boxed{\tan 2x =\frac{2\tan x}{1 - \tan^2 x}}
$$

**SUMS INSIDE A TRIGFUNC:**

5. Sum inside the sin. Sum the inverse multi
$$
\boxed{\sin(x + y ) = \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y}
$$
6. Sum inside the cosine. Subtract the multi but racism.
$$
\boxed{cos(x+y) = cos(x)cos(y) - sin(x)sin(y)}
$$
7. Sum inside the tan:
$$
\boxed{\tan(x+y) = \frac{\tan x + \tan y}{1 - \tan x\tan y}}
$$

**ADD SOME PI TO SIN**

8. Add half pi to sin? →  Get **cos**
$$
\sin(x+ \pi/2) = \cos x
$$

9.  Add one whoole pi to sin? → Get **minus sin**
$$
\sin(x + \pi) = - \sin x
$$
