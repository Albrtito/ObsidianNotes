Trigonometric relations are those that connect trigonometric functions between them. 
Really useful to reformulate some functions or statements to solve exercises, derivations, etc.

1. Everything squared is one
$$
\boxed{\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1}
$$
2. Sin of 2x? 2 times both
$$
\sin(2x) = 2 \sin(x) \cos(x)
$$
3. Cos of 2x? Subtract the squares
$$
cos(2x) = cos^2(x)
$$
