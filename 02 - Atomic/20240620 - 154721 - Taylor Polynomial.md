# Taylor polynomial 
Taylor polynomial is used to **approximate a function near a given point using a polynomial**

**NOTE:** Remark that is an approximation **near a given point** â†’ Remember this for limits


> [!NOTE] Definition: General form: 
> We define the Taylor polynomial of **degree n of f** near the point $x_0$ as:
> $$
P_{n,x_0}f(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^{n}\frac{f^{k)}(x_0)}{k!} (x-x_0)^k
> $$

**Remarks:**
+ When the point $x_0 = 0$ then the taylor polynomial is known as **McLaurin polynomial**
+ The following list compiles the basic taylor and McLaurin polynomials: [[20240620 - 160937 - Main Taylor Polynomials|Main Taylor Polynomials]]
