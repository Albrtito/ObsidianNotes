# Exercises - Order relations

## 13.1: 
+ **Obtain the Dom and Image:** Because it is reflexive the image and domain are equal to A.
+ **Obtain the Hasse diagram:** Apply the algorithm
+ **Obtain a total order compatible with R**: We can directly obtain $1\preceq 2 \preceq 3 \preceq 4 \preceq 5$
## 13.2: 
Let A the set A = {0, 1, 2} × {2, 5, 8}, and let us define the order relation R on A such that (a, b)R(c, d) ⇔ (a + b) | (c + d). Find the maximal, minimal, maximum, and minimum elements of the poset (A, R)
