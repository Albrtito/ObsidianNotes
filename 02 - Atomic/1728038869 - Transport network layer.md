# Transport network layer

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> The transport layer occupies itself of **sending the messages generated by the application layer through the network.** 
> 
> We’ll see in this note that there are challenges to that transport like transfering the data reliablely, controlling the rate of packages or solving congestion problems. We’ll also see the different protocols there are to send packets and how they work.

## Transport layer services:
Services and protocols provide **logical communication between systems,** they divide the host between: 
+ **Sender:** The one braking appart the message into packets and sending it
+ **Reciever:** The one recieving packets and sending them to the app layer

There are two protocols inside the transport layer: [[1727428451 - Definition - TCP|TCP]] and [[1727428429 - Definition - UDP|UDP]]


> [!attention] Differences between transport and network: 
> Transport layer is going to do the communication between **processes** while the network layer is doing the **communication betweeen hosts**.
