## Unit testing:
Verifies the **methods**. This is the smallest software unit. 
+ Weâ€™ll mainly focus on this type of testing during the software dev course. 
There are two main types of unit test.
1. [[20240501 - 123349 - White box testing|White box testing]]
2. [[20240501 - 123332 - Black box testing|Black box testing]]

## Creation of test:
Using 
1. Create a test class following: [[20240501 - 124636 - Equivalent test classes|Equiv. test classes]]
2. Create a setup method
	1. Add an input simulator if necessary (this means an input generator). 
3. Write the test case with **assertions** (more about how to write test with [[PythonLib-Unittest]])
4. Run the test
5. Check if failing or passing: If fails, review code or test, if pass, go to the next test
6. When everything works u have finished. 

This method complies with the TDD framework if there is no code to begin with and the code is created from passing test. In order to do so the creation of test class must be generated from the requirements
