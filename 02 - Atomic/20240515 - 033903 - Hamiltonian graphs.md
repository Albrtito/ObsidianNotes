# Hamiltonian graphs: 
Hamiltonian graphs are those graphs that **contain a cycle on a graph G such that the cycle contains all vertices of G exactly once**

> [!NOTE] Hamiltonian cycle /graph
> The hamiltonian cycle is the cycle on a graph g containing all vertices of G.
> **IF:** A graph admits a hamiltonian cycle **THEN:** It is a hamiltonian graph

**Remark:**
+ We can also find **hamiltonian paths**. Open paths that contain all vertices of G
+ Finding any of these properties is hard in most graphs
