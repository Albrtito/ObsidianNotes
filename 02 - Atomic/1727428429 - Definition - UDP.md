# UDP

> [!NOTE] Definition: 
> UDP is an **internet transport protocol service** that offers unreliable but faster data transfer. Itâ€™s a pseudo to **User Datagram Protocol**
> 
+ Requires c**onnectionless demultiplexing**
+ 
**Remarks:**
 + UDP exist because it needs much less memory than TCP (**Smaller header**) and requires less time to send the packages. 
 + It does not provide anything else than the data transfer by itself. Everything must be **developed in the application layer**.
