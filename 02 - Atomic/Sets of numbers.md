# Intro: 
A set of numbers is the same as a grouping of numbers. These numbers may all follow some constraint or rule (f.e. all even numbers can be grouped into a set) , but can also just be in a set because they where chosen randomly. 
There are some generally known sets that are usually used in mathematics such as natural numbers, real numbers, etc.
