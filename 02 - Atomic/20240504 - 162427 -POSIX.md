Portable Operating System Interface or POSIX is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer society. 

These standards specify both the system and user-level application programming interfaces (APIs) along with command line shells and utility interfaces.

During the OS course weâ€™ll use these standards for the programming of the labs.
