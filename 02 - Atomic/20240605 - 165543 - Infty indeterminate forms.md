When working with infinity we can find indeterminate forms. These forms are such as whose value **cannot be determined in advance** and may be different in each case. 

$$
\begin{gather}
\infty - \infty &\frac{\infty}{\infty} \\\\
\frac{0}{0} & 0\cdot \infty\\\\
 \infty^0 & 0 ^0\\\\
 1^\infty & 1^{-\infty}
\end{gather}
$$

Working with limits we find that some of this forms are simplified using methods such as **dividing by the greatest term, using the conjugate or finding the common factors.**
