# Semantic theory: 
While defining propositional and predicate calculus we have always worked with formulas, axioms, inference rules, etc. We work with the generalisation of the formula. 

However in semantic theory we’ll focus on the meaning of propositions(truth values), whether a proposition or a predicate is true or is false and how that affects the formula. 

The symbolisation is the same as the model is the same (propositional or predicate calculus)

We have been working with **only true or false sentences** for the logic course, this are **the only ones inside the scope of the course**. Then: 

Propositions and predicates can be either: 
+ **TRUE / 1**
+ **FALSE / 0**
## Truth tables: 
A truth table of a formula evaluates **ll possible evaluation scenarios / interpretations**  of the formula.
f.e: 
	If there was a formula such as $p \lor q$ it could be such as p is true and q is not, then the formula would be true as p or q means either p is true or q is true, if any of them are then the formula is true. 

For each connective there is a truth table that defines the relation: 

**Negation:**

**AND (Conjunction)**

**OR (Disjunction)**

**Conditional:**

### Solving with truth tables
With this four tables we can obtain the truth table of any formula:


f.e: (an example with propositions)
Verifying if the following is valid using a truth table
$$
   p \land ((p\lor q\rightarrow r)\rightarrow(p\rightarrow r))
$$
+ asterisk → Represents the whole formula
**Truth table**

Once we interpret the truth table we can see that for each of the possible combinations the whole formula may be true or false. 

**Remark:** To create all the possible combinations just write all binary numbers from 0 to $2^n$ where n is the number of propositions. 

+ Each combination resulting in a **true value** will be called **model**
+ Each combination resulting in a **false value** will be called **counterexample**

Based on the example presented above. There would be 4 models (the last four rows) and 4 counter-models (the first four rows)

### Analysis of the truth table results:
Based on the solutions to all possible combinations of the formula we can obtain different conclusions from the truth table: 

+ **Tautology:** If all combinations output true
+ **Contradiction:** If all combinations output false
+ **Contingency:** If we get some true and some false values
	+ Like the example above

We say that a formula is **satisfiable** if it is true for at least one interpretation. 
We say that a formula **without counterexamples is semantically valid. Namely: A tautology is semantically valid**
