# Semantic theory: 
While defining propositional and predicate calculus we have always worked with formulas, axioms, inference rules, etc. We work with the generalisation of the formula. 

However in semantic theory we’ll focus on the meaning of propositions(truth values), whether a proposition or a predicate is true or is false and how that affects the formula. 

The symbolisation is the same as the model is the same (propositional or predicate calculus)

We have been working with **only true or false sentences** for the logic course, this are **the only ones inside the scope of the course**. Then: 

Propositions and predicates can be either: 
+ **TRUE / 1**
+ **FALSE / 0**
## Truth tables: 
A truth table of a formula evaluates **ll possible evaluation scenarios / interpretations**  of the formula.
f.e: 
	If there was a formula such as $p \lor q$ it could be such as p is true and q is not, then the formula would be true as p or q means either p is true or q is true, if any of them are then the formula is true. 

For each connective there is a truth table that defines the relation: 

**Negation:**

**AND (Conjunction)**

**OR (Disjunction)**

**Conditional:**

### Solving with truth tables
With this four tables we can obtain the truth table of any formula:


f.e: (an example with propositions)
Verifying if the following is valid using a truth table
$$
   p \land ((p\lor q\rightarrow r)\rightarrow(p\rightarrow r))
$$
+ * → Represents the whole formula
**Truth table**

| p   | q   | r   | $p\lor q$ | $p\lor q \rightarrow r$ | $p\rightarrow r$ | $(p\lor q\rightarrow r)\rightarrow(p\rightarrow r)$ | *   |
| --- | --- | --- | --------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0         | 1                       | 1                | 1                                                   | 0   |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0         | 1                       | 1                | 1                                                   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1         | 0                       | 1                | 1                                                   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1         | 1                       | 1                | 1                                                   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1         | 0                       | 0                | 1                                                   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1         | 1                       | 1                | 1                                                   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1         | 0                       | 0                | 1                                                   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1         | 1                       | 1                | 1                                                   | 1   |


Once we interpret the truth table we can see that for each of the possible combinations the whole formula may be true or false. 

+ Each combination resulting in a **true value** will be called **model**
+ Each combination resulting in a **false value** will be called **counterexample**
