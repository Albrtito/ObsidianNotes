For this period I'll follow the  General, specific and operative objectives strategy. I'll divide the period in two. From march to July (une included as there are a few exams taking place in those dates) and July to September (the summer season). To keep track of the set objectives the [dailyNote](../99%20-%20Meta/1.%20Templates/dailyNote.md) template will be updated with all the task extracted in the operative objectives. 
This note will be reviewed periodically to modify any objectives and check that the chosen strategy is working. #review 
# General objectives: 
## 1. Use of RRSS and online learning resources
With a great use of social media comes great responsibility. I can really easily go towards a misusage of it all. I want to focus on using it for longer content. I recently discovered during the t3chfest that all CS media is on twitter. If I start using twitter or instagram I would like it to be focused on the content I have chosen to see. 
- [ ] DONE?
**Update:2024-06-27** The use of social media started good but moved towards a misusage similar to the one I had previously (to march of 2024). From now on my objective here is to center in communication and connection. Still use everything for **long content** **focused on learning**. But focus the usage more in the control less in the proper usage.
## 2. Sleep / Wake up in time
Sleeping has always troubled me. Now with the afternoon uni courses it has all gotten even worse. This is one of the main objectives I want to work on, controlling and learning about sleep so that I can use it as a power instead of it controlling me. 
- [ ] DONE?
**Update:2024-06-27** Not having a proper good night sleep and refusing to do it has been one of the main reasons I could not feel happy during the day and I woke up really angry with myself for it. Aprovechando que estos días de verano ya no tengo un horario que me requiera despertarme a una hora voy a intentar ir acostumbrando a mi cuerpo a levantarse más pronto. Irme a dormir antes (o lo más pronto posible dependiendo del plan) y dejar que mi cuerpo se vaya acostumbrando a dormir las 8 horas y despertarse con ese horario. 
## 3.Scouts: 
During this period there are three main focuses. Camps, Documentation and the  MTL course. Working on more courses would be a nice thing to do. However It doesn't seem realistic. 
- [ ] DONE?
## 4.Uni & Learning: 
I've been struggling with university since I started with it. I think it's mostly because of a lack of effort from my part. At the start of this year I noticed a big change when I  focused on going to all clases. Even more with the friendships  and connections I started to create. What I'm lacking is success, seeing my efforts create something I'm proud of. 
- [ ] DONE?
**Update:2024-06-27** Aquí lo que veo es falta de trabajo constante. Durante el verano quiero tener proyectos. Enfocarme en aprender cosas que me obliguen a trabajar de forma constante en ellas.



# Specific&Operative (March - June)

The main focus for this time is to create a routine. All objectives are mostly based on things to do daily or every week. This is because I haven't been following this methods and I still need to build up this routine. Once the routine is build everything goes detrás.

## 1.1 Use Instagram and Twitter as learning spaces

### 1.1.1 Using the search tab to search 
(content just to fill some gap time)(even then better to just read)
- [ ] DONE?
### 1.1.2 Read 30 min per day
I'm not using reading as a whole general objective because even though I think it is of vital importance in my life. Right now learning h0w to manage the resources I have to learn also contains managing RRSS and others. 
Having the kindle always near is a nice way to promote this.
- [ ] DONE?


## 1.2 Control the time usage of RRSS

### 1.2.1 Maintain daily RRSS usage under 1h 

**Recap: 2024-05-29** This is not going in a bad direction. However the use I’m giving it does not feel right. It I used it to post maybe, but just to keep on seeing content I cannot later remember?
- [x] DONE


## 1.3 Control the situational usage of RRSS
### 1.3.1 Tener un propósito antes de entrar en RRSS
Keeping the time at the home tab as a previous objective reflects already helps. However there are many times when I don't choose to take out my phone. I just do it by instinct.  By thinking of what to use the RRSS before actually opening this stops. Another good thought to have at this moment is how long am I going to stay with the RRSS. Many times I won't be able to stop and time flies by. 
**Recap: 2024-05-29** This has gone quite well, I now start asking that question (what is this for) before entering. I just cannot find other purposes rather than, to look at what my friends have posted. And I don’t mean it as “I don’t care”, just, it is so little for such huge RRSS apps.

## 2.1 State the reasons for sleeping schedule
It's really hard to do anything just with pure willforce. By stating why I should go to sleep or wake up earlier and really thinking about the benefits I can have a better reason then to awake up.
Reading about sleep and learning all of the reasons I will really benefit is useful, however I don't think I will have time for it during this semester. 
### 2.1.1 Plan the next day before going to bed. 
Enfasis on planing the next morning and objectives that will be checked out by waking up at that time. 
- [ ] 
**Recap: 2024-05-29** : This has not been met. And even those days that has. It doesn’t make that an impact. However there hasn’t been enough days to compare. In order for this to succeed I need to change a great part of journaling into the night time. Before going to bed. 

## 2.2 Create a routine around sleep. 
### 2.2.1 Do 30 min of daily sport/movement
- [ ] 
### 2.2.3 Don't use RRSS after bedtime - read
- [ ]

## 3.1 Mantener responsabilidades dentro de secretaría
### 3.1.1 Pasar las cuotas mensualmente 
- [x] DONE?
**Recap: 2024-05-29** : Estoy aprendiendo bastante con las cuotas y las reuniones con la tesorería. Por ahora esto se esta haciendo y guay.
### 3.1.2 Recoger documentación de Madrid cada dos semanas
- [x] DONE?
**Recap: 2024-05-29** : Yes, without a huge impact further on in the course but done. 
## 3.2 Aumentar responsabilidades de secretaría antes de campamentos y acampadas. 
### 3.2.1 Darle la tabarra a pi para que me vaya contando cositas e ir pudiendo enterarme de las cosas
- [ ] DONE?
**Recap: 2024-05-29** En esto no me he enfocado, pi tampoco ha transmitido. La secretaría se ha quedado algo estancada. Como reflexión, para verano sería interesante involucrarse más pero no sabría como.

## 4.1 Create a sense of community inside the university. Be there. 
### 4.1.1 Go to university all days during class hours
Even if I'm not in class, this means I'm near the community, I interact with them and create a sense of community. 
- [ ] DONE? → **NO**


**Recap: 2024-05-29** I can take this objective as done as there are no classes left. I could not do this but I got the sense of good that doing it could do. It has been very hard to go, less if it’s by car with my dad. Either way, know that I know there is people there everyday and that the community really makes me happier I’ll try it next year.

### 4.1.2 Do at least two nights out with the uni group 
- [x] DONE?
**Recap: 2024-05-29** : We’ve done one in Ignacio’s birthday and another one will be this Friday, not bad.
## 4.2 Obtain an average higher than 6
Better to achieve it with a higher notes than not being able to because I asked to much of myself
**NO: 5.86**
### 4.2.1 Daily use of active recall (space repetition) in obsidian
- [x] DONE?
**Recap: 2024-05-29**:  This has not been done every day but I have notices the huge impact it did. I did not study a huge amount for some of the exams but I already had a base builded from active recalling the theory. Once I implemented generalised exercises it went even better.
## 4.3 Focus on first year courses
### 4.3.1 On busy weeks, prioritise Calculus, Discrete and Logic


# Specific&Operatives(June-September)
## Extra: Enfoque en moverse y hacer actividades fuera de casa. 
Cuanto más tiempo estoy en casa más fácil es que me encierre en mi mismo. Los planes y cosas que vaya ha hacer durante estos meses de verano ya serán fuera de casa, incluir yo los míos propios y enfocarme en estar yo fuera (auqn sea por mi cuenta) me parece algo que aunque no sea actualmente un objetivo general le quiero dar aquí una importancia para tenerlo en mente cuando organice. 

## Extra: Uso de la nota diaria:
El uso que me parece más correcto de la nota diaria es reflexionar en lo que se ha hecho en ese día, que se podría haber cambiado o mejorado. Esto se hace por la noche. 
Por la mañana se reorganizarían los objetivos para adaptarlos a ese día y ser realistas.
