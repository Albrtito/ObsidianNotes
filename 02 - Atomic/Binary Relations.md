# Definition:

![[20240415 - 110638 - Definition 122 - Binary Relations|Definition 122]]

# Representation of a relation: 
In order to represent a binary relation there are several **equivalent** methods: 
+ Use the expression (see definition above)
+ List of elements. 
	f.e: For a two dimensional relation list the points in the relation 
+ Use a venn’s diagram (arrows)
+ [[20240415 - 111928 -Adjacency matrix of a binary relation|Binary R. Adjacency matrix]]
+ Cartesian (painting it as points → What if it’s not two dimensional?)
## When in the relation $V = W$: 
If the relation is between elements of the same set (see [[20240415 - 110638 - Definition 122 - Binary Relations#^420fb6| Binary relations on one set]] the , then we can represent it **as a graph** as it’s adjacency matrix can be seen as the one form a graph.
+ The directions of the arrows matter (as it states the difference between the relation (x,y) and (y,x))
+ The graph only has one copy of V

# Operations with relations:

## Composition of relations:

# Types of binary relations: 
Once defined the basic concept of a relation we can specify between different types of relations based on the properties of each of them. 
For the discrete math course in UC3M we’ll be seeing only equivalence relations.
