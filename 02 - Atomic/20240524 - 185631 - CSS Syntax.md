# CSS Syntax:

```css 
div.bold-text{
	font-weight: 700;
}
```

This has the following elements: 
+ `div.bold-text`: Is a **selector**
+ `font-weight`: IS a **property**
+ `700` : Is the **value of the property**

This structure repeats on and on. We choose the type of element we want to alter and for each of itâ€™s properties we specify a value. 

## Selectors: 
There are a lot of different selectors, the main ones are: 

### Universal selector:
The universal selector changes properties from elements of **any type**

```css 
*{
	color: purple;
}
```
In this example we see that the color purple is applied to all elements of any type.

### Type selectors:
 The type selector selects elements of only one type. 
```css 
div {
	color: purple;
}
```
Here the div selector only changes color to div elements. 

### Class selectors: 
Class selectors select all elements with one [[20240524 - 190013 - HTML Classes|HTML Class]]
