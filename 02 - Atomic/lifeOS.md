# Strategy:
The idea of this file is to describe the current strategy that is being followed in order to keep track of all the objectives, notes and routines that are  being followed. Also explain why those particular choices have been made and how. 

## General, specific and operative objectives.
This strategy is based on the creation of objectives. These objectives are divided between general objectives, created annually, specific objectives created every semester. and operative objectives that specify and determine what are the exact things that are needed in order to achieve the sete specific objectives. 

This last part is the key. Wherever I look to find some key aspect of motivation I keep seeing reading, listening the same exact thing. DO, DO, DO. The key aspect is not to organise things that need to be done. The key part is doing them. 
Jeff Haden describes it in [The motivation myth](The%20motivation%20myth). Once the general and specific objectives are set they must be forgotten in order to achieve them. 

### Implementations: 
+ [Objectives from March 23 to September 23](Objectives%20from%20March%2023%20to%20September%2023.md)
