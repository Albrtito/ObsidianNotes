# Separable ODEs
Separable ODEs are those ODEs such as de DE is a [[20240528 - 104744 - Definition - Separable Equations|Separable Equations]]

> [!NOTE] Definition:
> Separable ODE's are of the form: 
>$$
M(x) + N(y) \frac{dy}{dx} = 0
>$$
>+ M(x) is a function in x: Only x as the unknown
>+ N(y) is a function in y: Only y as the unknown

## Solving separable ODEs:
