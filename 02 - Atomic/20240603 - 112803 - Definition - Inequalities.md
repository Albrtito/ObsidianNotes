Inequalities define relations between the elements of a set, there are four of them: 

$a > b$ : “Greater than” → a greater than b

$a < b$ : “Smaller than” → a smaller than b

$a \geq b$ : "Greater or equal than" -> a greater or equal than b

$a \leq b$ : "Smaller or equal than" -> a smaller or equal than b

These relations have the following **properties:**
 1. $a>b \Rightarrow a + c > b + c : \forall c$

 2. $a > b \text{ and } c > 0 \Rightarrow ac > bc$
+ If the element multiplying is positive there is no change to the relation

3. $a > b \text{ and } c < 0 \Rightarrow ac < bc$
+ If the element multiplying is negative, then the relation changes sides.
